Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
No...
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I hope so.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
He was, like, a total babe
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
It's just you.
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
Thirty-two.
Who is she?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Okay!  I wasn't sure
You get the girl.
What do you think?
You just said
I'm on it
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
Do what?
William didn't even go to high school
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
I'm fine. I'm
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
I told you
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Look up, sunshine
Maybe.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
So what's your excuse?
Yes
Answer the question, Patrick
It's just something I had.  You know
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Funny.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
I am, Your Eminence
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Call them.
All of them created by people like me.
Ask him if he will help.
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
What are you saying?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
I knew you would.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Immediately.
You must be mad...!
You think I don't know that?
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then why?
What about Oleg?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Can I see your back?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Yes, I considered it.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Right.
I'll make some for us.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
It was my decision, not his.
No!  Nothing happened.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
When?
Stay with her.
This isn't homicide school.
You got any better ideas?
Better than one.
I'm on duty.
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
What do you want?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
Promise?
Tonight.
Thank you.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Dog food.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where's Czech girl?
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Two weeks.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Yes.  Both.
We have no money.  Come on.
Be quiet.  Watch.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Ha. Ha.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
We started over, you can too.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You want the tape?  There it is!
In love?  With who?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Excuse me?
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
How long they been livin' here?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Sure, what is it?
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Yes, I know.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Well, what is it?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
When are you coming home?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Any clue as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
I ain't tired yet.
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Shit.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
No way...
Hello. And goodbye.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
There's nothin' to talk about.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You made the front page.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Fuck you.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
How would you know?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Try and take it.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Leeloo's in trouble?
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
We will be ready, Lord.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I'm so tired...
Exactly.
Been here long?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Have you identified it?
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
You don't understand...
What?
Bullshit.
Nobody knows anything.
I want to watch you work.
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
You betrayed us.
Call me Tom.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I want his name.
Don't think I won't.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
They're no friends of mine.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Yeah... guess so.
I'm not a cop.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
Specialty product.
It's their Presidential Suite.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Nope.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
I try to be.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
You've found missing persons before.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
I didn't mean to...
You should be.
I remember.  You just left...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
No, you may not.
What?
I'm sure they're around.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Let me talk to you.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Avoid-all-contact-day.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
No shit.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
I want to talk about the baby.
My father!  He's not - ?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Yes?
Helen.  I appeal to you -
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Something wrong?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Obviously.
Toward the Pole!
No. Black.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
No.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
They said.
Deers have ears too.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
How'd you get the job?
Right!
Shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
I just think you used to be bad.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Oh.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Okay.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
I figured you already heard.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
You? Why?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
Is...? She's dead then?
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Atta-go.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Call it what you want.
Bang!
Huh?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
No thanks. I don't drink.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Not particularly.
Yeah.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Jim... for godsake!
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
Any of us?
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Stand by.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Scared. We're scared.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
They've gotta be joking.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
She's a big girl.  She understands.
What?
Flying the plane.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
You better take this.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Let me by, Elaine.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Ted, please be careful.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
I guess this is a first for you.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
He's a boy dog.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
That's right.
A hospital? What is it?
He had fish, too.
Well...
You expect me to believe that?
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
The cockpit? What is it?
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Lay off, asshole.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
I'll handle it.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Ss-ai!
Tell me about it...
What is it?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
I can't!  Do you mind!
Say again?  All after incinerators?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
About seventeen days.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Seal the door.
Yes.  A little girl.
Wah...?  Where are...?
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
His Grace is very angry with you.
What do you mean?
Is there a part for me?
You were sublime.
Extremely clever.
Hardly.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Humiliated?
Yes!
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
That's stupid.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
What?
Eat my - ah!
Well, don't do that again!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Your father is dead.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
Madame. How can I help you?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Really?
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Gertrude!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Ah-ha.
Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
This one will.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Bene.
Not that I've seen.
Is he working?
Are you sure it's an opera?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
I liked the horse.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
So there you are. What do you say?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
How could I not?
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I can't say. Really
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
How could it not, Excellency?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
No! No, it's him!
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Strange!
Come. Let's begin.
Yes.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
You go fast!
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I think you'd better.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
On the contrary.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
No? Was Mozart a good man?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
What difference does that make?
Oh my son, my poor son!
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
You must be mad.
Never mind.
Incredible.
Ah.
I can't wait.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Right.
How old are you?
My best friend. My very best friend.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
I was dreaming again?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Do me an enormous favor?
A doper werewolf.
The zoo?
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
I think he's a Jew.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Why are you doing this to me?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Lunatic?
Yes.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
You ask them.
You ask them.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
What was it?
Heathcliffe.
Do you think it's a dog?
I'll tell you when we get there.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Jack, are you really dead?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Hi, David.
What about the zoo?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
I beg your pardon?
Matt?
He has?
Yeah.
I remember once when your account checked.
What good will that do?
Take it easy, Clark.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
We'll discuss that in the board room.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Yes, sir.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars—
Yeah, swell.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Yes, sir.
Dude Finlay?
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
It's tougher than it looks.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
That's it.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Ah.
Ho-yah!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Such as?
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Jim was old enough...
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
A fair number, Ma.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Sparkling rocks?
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Don't swear.
Yes ma'am.
Thanks.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I think so.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
They had to be dealt with!
Good.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
It's going to be a long winter.
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Nice?
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
Yes, dear.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Why?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Yes, Courtney?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
The message you left.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Lucky, I guess.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Maybe it's just the light.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
New card. What do you think?
Ask me a question.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
See you then.
Yes, sir.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Hello 
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Why would I?
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Where did you go to school?
You seem...nervous.
Well...
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well, I could he wrong.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I can't just walk away!
...Whaddo I do?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He wasn't acting?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Right... Right.
Definitely.
The wrong place?
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
Just do what I'm asking!
Longitude 109 --
What?
Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Long story. Not that interesting.
Then and now.  But not right now.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
The Day Care?
Who can we trust?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
What?
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
Speaking of which...
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Kiss me.
Hey, how are you?
Smashing!
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Yes?
Oh, and Austin...
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Yes Basil?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Go! Just go!
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Kiss me.

Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Yes.
Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.

Three days.
So I'm still ...
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Promised? Who promised?
Impossible?
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Thank you, Steed.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
I'm already married ...
Choices?
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
I wasn't about to.
Did he say who?
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Always.  Except ...
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Who's now vanished.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Anyone particular in mind?
In your operation.
Walk over to the window ...
I was at Harrow ...
Did I? My mistake.
Ugh ...
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
I want Debbie.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Maybe it had something to do.
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
I'm going now, Cole.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
You know your father enjoys his company.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Screw that.
Milt?
That's it.
Right.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
It's all right...  So have I.
The best table in the house.
Oooooo.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Fuck you.
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
How do you know?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
You look great.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?

I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
What reason?
Are you going public with this?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Cute.
It's not your roof anymore.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
You treated me like shit.
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
He works for me.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
You mean you could use it.
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
I want 15 on the Mets.
Yeah. I'm sure.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
YEAH!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
What do I do?
Why are you smiling so?
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Meaning?
Well do something about it.
How you sound?
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
What do you want me to say?
Is that good or bad?
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
In time.
Yeah.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Where is he?
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
We should go out on a double date.
Around...
You slept too near where you got in?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
Say what, Manray?
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
Where are you bound for?
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Neither!
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
He loves me, as I love you.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
I just don't like it.
Okay.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
I...
You're the only one missing a grenade.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Mr. Hardy?
Stop.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Maybe --
Well, he's a good soldier.
And the problem is you only got three.
Home, I'm done.
Not for long.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
The very same.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Little bit.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Think it'll work?
Nah.
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
I don't think I want to hear this --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Childs.
We're not going anywhere.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Sir, yes, sir!
I don't expect to.
Then do it.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Really?
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
Beats me.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Can we talk?
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
It would kill you, huh?
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Story of my life.
There is no softer ground than town.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
You didn't become crazy.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I'll help you.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
We rented a car.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Do you know who that is?
You know what for.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Uh... Yes.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Oh.  We are Russian.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Tell me.
You can stay tonight.
What? What does he want?
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
They go.
I don't want to know.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
I know you just want to punish me --
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I said I don't have any.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Okay we won't talk about it.
I don't hate you.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Thank Christ for that.
Well what have you got?
Have you had any before?
No.
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
What's your name?
It's alright.
Whatever.
Tell me about it.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Don't make it less true.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
You liked what I brung ya?
At church?
I do. God's truth. I do.
Hey.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
I don't love ya no more.
Let go...
You sayin' you'll do what?
Don't need none.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
What do you want?
No ma'am.
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
I don't fuckin' cook.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
You drink whiskey?
No joke.
Anything.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Looks like you know a song.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
This all looks wonderful.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
That's right.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
The hell are you talkin' about?
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
No.
You all right?  You okay?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
So I bring some cheese?
Let's go.  Him first.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Why's that?
I don't think so.
I don't remember you saying no.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Yeah.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
He killed a police officer.
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
Well stocked.
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
Anywhere.
Come here.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Tomorrow, he says.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Yeah.  I got it.
You start.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
I think we're through for the night.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
No problem.
Ya.
I gotta piss.
No.  I got a problem.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Do you recognize any of them?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Are you for real?
It would be my child.
Yeah.
Where is he?
How are you doing?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Holden got hit.
I'll see you in a minute.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
How do you know I'm not?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
They left.
I was hoping you'd say that.
What's your problem?
What's that?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
My office.
Oh, brother...
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
No, you get out of here.
No, I'm lost.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Doing what?
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Sure.
In the house?
Okay!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yes!
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
No.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Uh-huh.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Juneau.
Yeah.
That would knock my father out.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I just don't want to.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
What?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
You don't look thirty-five.
Good!
Are you in trouble, son?!
A psychiatrist?!
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
He drank it hot?
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Really?
To go up.
Honey?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What shall we call him?
Right here!
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Mutants?!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
Yes, dear, I know.
I forgot some of my stuff.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I see "elegant."
That's what I'm sensing.
Give it back to him.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Roger, Wolf One.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
It must be great.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Only you and the photo lab.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
I wanted to see you.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Then you got undressed.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
No way.
I, I don't know.
Yes, I like you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Same here.
Yes.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Come on Dorothy.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Yes.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Be right down.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Yeah, but.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Okay, okay. Bye.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Shoot.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Go ahead.
Sandy?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Go find one.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
I-I'll tip her.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
C'mon!
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Shut it. It's Ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Oh, we're good man.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What?
Why was I not informed of this?
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Hey, Murph.
Well, what'ya do?
Yes.
I believe these young men are right.
No. They would never do that.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Yes.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
What does Starsky say?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
Yeah, I saw it.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Just turn right here.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
We got it. We got it.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
I'm not. But there's --
I know.
How much?
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Right now.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Yes. I do.
You're all clear.
Roger.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I'll see you there.
I'll get him.
Yeah.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
Nothing.
How big is it?
Behind Bob's house.
Dignan, I --
Thanks.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Absolutely.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Yeah. He said that.
Why not?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
No, I don't mind.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Where were you?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
That never would of --
Let's cut the bullshit.
OK, Bob.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
His name was Swifty?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Don't count it.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
I don't know.
They said he's a drug dealer.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Come on, Dignan.
You don't even know his name.
What's his name?
I never agreed to that.
Look. We want you on the job.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
I think so.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Sure.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
Will it track back to us?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
It was staged?
Jesus...
That's not what happened to your parents.
I don't want you to forgive me.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I'm sorry.
Felt a little light.
Sorry. Old habits.
What's going on in Berlin?
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
I should be better by now.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- hang on --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
You do?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Abbott?
So when was I here?
No. You never worked Berlin.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Me? Four years.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
I don't want to be a martyr.
It's up to us, Hamish!
A patriot!
Shall I leave, M'lord?
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Did it work?
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
They've tricked us.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Um... can dad come this time?
No.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
I thought you were a December baby.
Like Ozzy.
Duck, here they come.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
I walk differently?
He's a fucking maniac!
Ha! Where's that?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Stop! Take me back!
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I was?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
We'll find out soon enough.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I come from a big family.
Meant no offense.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Oh my God oh my God...
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
I came with Captain Renault.
No.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Oh, yes.
Yes, Monsieur.
-- Will he keep his word?
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
What is your name?
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Yes, something.
Good day.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Not an easy day to forget.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Please.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Put them on the table.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
And Laszlo?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Goodnight.
No, Victor, there isn't.
How do you do?
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Right.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Yes, rather.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
No. It's all arranged.
I slept very well.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Good day.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Huh!
Victor Laszlo.
His escape.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Put that gun down.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Take your hands off me!
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Yeah, boss?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Thirsty.
No.
Moon's too bright.
I'm putting it off.
Fix raft first.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Die tomorrow or die today.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I can't even keep fish alive.
You can't go now.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
Yes there is.
You have any children?
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
That about sums it up.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
I'm touched.
I was making a point.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
We're on.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Permission granted.
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
I'm *not* a doctor!
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Why not?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Where's Mandalay?
Sure... I'll see you around.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
Just a little privacy.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Well, we have to help her!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
That's true.
You mean somebody asked?
He's leaving...
Did you grow up around here?
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Have you enlisted?
It's all very normal.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
Where'd she get you?
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Obviously.
It's my turn!
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Know who I am, Jake?
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Guess so.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
Tonight. Just me.
She's up for it.
Eight A.M. flight.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Help me.
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I don't trust anyone.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Glenn talked you out of it.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
You sure we're clear?
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Where the hell is she?
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
I'm sorry.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
You're a weasel.
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
The King.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
It's just insurance.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Maybe another time.
Goodnight.
It's the tension.
All men are cheats.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Eight-fifty.
I'm working on that soccer story.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I love you Jack, you know that.
Fine.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
I hate public transport.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Impossible to calculate.
Just an accident. Nothing.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
And I thought you were a bright woman.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Who...
You did?
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Thanks.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Good call. Help yourself.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I was at Beadles.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Give me 365.
Where's the magnet?
All right, Mr Reynolds.
I can see.
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Arm yourself, bomb.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Bomb?
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
And you can only do it once, right?
So if you detonate in...
I hereby name this star Fred.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Not now!
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Ah... pity, pity...
What was that, Doolittle?
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Talk to the bomb.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
I'm on a break.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
Who's Camille?
You're not still pissed?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
No time.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Later.
You didn't...
But why can't we stay here?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Girl's gotta make a living.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
I'm not a half bad cook.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
We are not fine.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
No, I meant this.
The other one like you...
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
I'm sorry.
That's what soldiers do, right?
Look, thank you for this but--
You don't want to.
I need to talk to her.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
You did.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Then what?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
You're crazy.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
I'm on my way.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
What if he's on the level?
I'm the victim here.
How'd you get her out of town?
She was the one--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
More than anything in the world.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Thanks.
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Bye.
YO, DOOFUS!
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
The paint!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Go ahead, Jam.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
That's it?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Donnie.
I didn't say shit.
Where did you come from?
With, like, images?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
And what?
What's wrong with you?
But you're OK?
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
It feels wonderful.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
What is her name?
Yes.
How are things going at school?
What else do you think about during school?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Goodbye, Donald.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Because you tell Mom everything.
Everything is going to be just fine.
That's enough.
It is a big deal.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Beg pardon?
There's no rule!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Really?
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Oh-you-beccha.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
C'mere. I love you so much.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yeah...
Are we on "Cops" again?
Loretta, shut it.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
You don't know where this is gonna...
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Wisconsin.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Oh no, I can't do it.
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
I don't wanna work at all.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Anything else? 
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
It must be done right away.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
But -
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I thought everything was working out fine.
One or two?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
Do you?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
I'll get my bag.
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
He must have taken quite a fall.
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I am very pleased to meet you.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
Romance!
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
y-y-yes--
Won't be a moment.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yes.
The children! May I see?
Of course.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Oh no, I couldn't.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag?
And who might you be, sir?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
There IS no one.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
But surely you know...?
Who?
But, Erik...
That's right!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
I see the world.
Well... isn't it great?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
I'm sure it's lovely.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Yes?
Don't talk nonsense.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
I don't suppose... no...
Ah.
Louder.
I didn't mean to!
What a stupid idea.
Well... no...
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
What?
She got me thinking...
Sorry.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Keitel Blacksmith?
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
For your own sake... For the others... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Like you got rid of Snorri!
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Me too.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Really? Because --
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
What?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
You pick it.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Okay.
Yeah? Oh, great!
Yes.
You'll call me, right?
You didn't say anything about my hair.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Do you remember what we talked about?
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
It's very late.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Um, no.
Female.
It's dark.
A bully? Moi?
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
How's it going?
Long day thinking.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Any messages, Carmen?
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
What? What do you mean?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Go back to sleep.
Where?
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Can I... I brought some --
I know what it is.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah. Of course.
That's fine, Stan.
Jesus.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I know who you are.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
The Clock People?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
I'm staying with the Countess.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
About...
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
So now you're bummin' around?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
The containment, Second Containment...
What?
Hurry.
Trauma.
And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
No.
Go on.
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
A power drain --
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
I built it.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
You... You can't do that!
Son of a bitch!
Starck, give me a read.
What is it, Smith?
Get out of there now!
Oxygen is not the problem.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
What is it, Starck?
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
No. I'll be right back.
He's dead...
He served on the Goliath.
Keep him talking.
I don't care.
Ship's log.
It wants me. I have to go.
It means nothing.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Baby, you're scaring me.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Got it, teach.
Reed?... Sue?
What do you mean "complete"?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
You've been working out.
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
I can go hotter!
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Girl...?!
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
And that's a good thing?
That's good. That's uh... good.
Excuse me?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And reverse the mutations --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Don't worry about it.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
This is how I dress all the time.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Sis.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
I don't know. I was just curious.
I didn't say that.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Okay, Dennis.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
You first.
I know it's yours.
We've got to get an abortion?
It's definitely your mama.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
Really?
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
I'm really pretty busy...
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
How often do you go?
Fascinating.
Then don't hassle it.
All right.
I like sex.
Really?
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Not since November.
Thanks a lot.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
No.
Dartmouth?!
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
What's that?
If you graduate.
How about the point?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Two Cokes.
Yes... It makes sense.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Tell me. What do you want?
What do you mean by that?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
What?
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
Jesus.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Some of what?
Yes!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
I fear nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Come on, come on.
And the head?
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Fuck no.
Your parents of relation?
What?
What's in the back?
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Oh, no.
Really?
Okay then.
He only shot you once.
Open?
Covered.
Get outta here.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
No shit.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
I'm sure.
Whoa!
I just hit it like you said.
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Excuse me, sir?
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Huh.
A rich actress.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Sort of.
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
What night?
All square, Doc.
...I see.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
No.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I love you too, Francie.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Are you an actor?
Not me. But other people seem to.
What?
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Oh no...
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
What's that?
Oh Harry...
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
I'm not sure.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
It's your fan mail, little sister.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
And what's that?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
Yeah?
She's not for you.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Open this door for no-one!
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Quite a few.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
I resent God's monopoly.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
A... week?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Victor, explain yourself.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Ah. An explorer.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
You want to leave?
Sure.
Un-hunh.
You're right. It makes no sense.
Good point.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
I had to.
Whatever you make yourself.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Ned!
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Just my son and I.
Have you ever been there before?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
I said new, this is an '90.
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
On the dresser.
Come again?
Sorry, I need everybody.
Died instantly?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
In other words, no.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
Everybody goes home!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Sure.
Mexicans.
You asked me if I would --
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Me too.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
You callin' him a liar?
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
One... Two... Three.
I'm gonna go get the money.
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
What does that mean?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Where are you?
Thank you, ensign.
Who's "we"?
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Straight up?
So I'll get a fair shot?
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir?  What did he say?
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
I'll act surprised.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
California.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
I oughtta report you.
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Just like you would be.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Thanks, Wick.
Not me.  You?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
The JFK? In the rain!?
You must have quite some harem.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Really? I'd like to find out.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
What's it to you?
Mr. Caiman...
So have dinner with me tonight.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Well, I think you're cute.
Allez, allez!
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
We, have already taken care of them.
It's okay. I know her.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Is that the bathroom?
Thanks.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
How did you come to that conclusion?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
What?  Up?
What's the weather like outside?
It's suicide.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
You smiled at me.
Let me think. I need time to think.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
I... certainly, but-
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
You... You mean Earth?
And determination.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It doesn't have eyes.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Pedal to the metal...
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
I wish she was beneath me.
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
You go too far, Benedict.
That you would have known you can trust me.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Lafayette is a child!
Oh, come now...
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
To win this war I need an army.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
I say!
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Farrah. Come here.
You're right.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
What about her?
Get something going there.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
Three.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
You say look at you?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Whatever you want, Ray.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
That's right. As a matter of fact...
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
They always paid.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
What's that?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.
Who told you that?
How? By taking my money?
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
A real bargain.
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Are you going down?
I'll go. I'll go.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Don't say a fuckin' word.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Pick 'n' Save.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
And after all, you have such morals.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Damn mind of it's own.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I like my job.
Gimme a break.
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Get up.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Not in the eyes of the law.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
I think you better see this for yourself.
You smashed it!
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Conveniently enough for you.
Sorry.
Hell yeah.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Only way to be.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
No. I'll try again later.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Not our mystery guest again.
Victims of what?
What's that supposed to mean?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
So you killed them?
I think I see it pretty well.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Of course they did.
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
We've done it before.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
We could call for help.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
God, how horrifying.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
About what?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
JUST DO IT!
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
I see... interesting...
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
What do you mean?
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
No.
I guess.
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Why do you have that stupid poster?
How long have you been up?
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Okay... I promise.
Are you ready to go?
How perfect.
You loser!
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
There's my dad with Joanie.
You're better at it.
She says she wants to MMPH!
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
As always.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
I didn't get it either.
I don't believe you.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That rules!
Like what?
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Just some people from work...
Why? What did he say?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Seymour does.
Fine, and how are you?
Well why do I care about that?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Wow!
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
For nineteen years...
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
...I better not...
Jesus, how can you stand her?
I'm just being realistic.
I hate sports.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I dunno, I...
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Call me sometime.
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
She's not at home?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
What do you mean?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
I think it's been a pleasure.
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
And it worked?
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Then why do you stay?
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
Then we agree. 
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
Somehow I guessed. 
Only in life... 
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Good night, Janosz.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I won't.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
Okay, let's take a look.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Thanks.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
Does she know anything about babies?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Same difference.
Hi, Egon.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
Okay.
I know.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
From where -- Neptune?
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
No, the slime is rising.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
I'm Peter --
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Wonder what?
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Yeah, yeah.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Print is dead.
In the physical sense.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Are you Peter Venkman?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Then my theory was correct.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Yeah, I can smell it.
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
I blame myself.
We'd better adjust our streams.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do we do now?
Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Third floor.  Get down here,
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
It's not good, Pete.
Who was the architect?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
For the gods, spit it out!
Yes?  Go on!
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
But have never been?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Let him trust Quintus.
Death is a very light thing for you.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
Where is the car?
Yes, I do.
Wait a minute.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
I do.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Here he comes.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
What do you think?
Did you say rape her?
I don't feel well.
Then what?
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
I don't know.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
What?
You mean you're confused?
I'll think about it.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
No, Benjamin.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
The day after tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Yes I am.
Plastics.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
You heard me. Out of here.
Could you bring it up?
Well I'll hand it to you.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
What?
Where is your luggage?
It's down the hall.
That's right.
Right.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
All right. Now finish your drink.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Come on.
Then why do you keep running away?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Of course.
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Now?
Why don't you get it.
Benjamin.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Yes?
Why don't you watch?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
I don't.
Yes I do.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Man, is this interesting.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
No.
Well I can't.
Don't tell Elaine.
At college.
How do you think.
Do you remember the make of the car?
That's enough.
Don't talk about Elaine?
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Did I say that?
But it's not.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
May I stay then?
Then give me your word you won't.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Do exactly what I say.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
Nothing else.
Well, wait.
Not if you don't want to.
Goodnight.
We haven't.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I know.
How long have we known each other now?
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
I will.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Mrs. Robinson?
Benjamin Braddock.
Can you look through the glass.
That what he says. Right?
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
And what are you going to do?
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Have you got that skeleton key?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
No -- no -- no -- no...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
I don't like your tone.
You?
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Where downstairs?
You're very funny --
All right. We'll dance.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Yes -- tired...
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
You are beautiful!
Oh -- 
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
Very early in the morning.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Yes, quite.
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
A little strange, Baron.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
If we could scare up some men to play.
All right then.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
Be quiet.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I don't know.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
This gentleman can have my room.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
Stay where you are.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
You're trembling.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Then you will please wait outside.
I got ten marks for that.
Skiing? 
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
What?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh, yes.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
You're sweet.
Why not?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Such nonsense.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Me?
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Bobo, no, I --
You expect me to buy this?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Goody!
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Henry, no!
Can't move.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
I guess I owe you my life.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
That's right.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
No.
I don't see why not.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
NO!
Scram. Go home.
In your other hand.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Upstate.
Take a hike, you mean?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Yes, I know, I know.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
Yes.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
I think someone broke into my house.
No.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
John...
I can see that.  Why?
Then I'll get caught.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
Looks great.  It does.
Never.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Can't you hold it?
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Where's Shane?
Very insightful.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
You've been watching too much TV.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Here.  Let me try.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
Retiring.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
Leave the boy.  Take me.
A bitch.
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Let's talk about it some other time.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Let's talk about something else.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
You.
Everybody thinks that.
How are you, honeybunch?
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Our pleasure.
I've considered that.
That can be arranged.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Out!  Out!
Sir?
Dr. Woodly.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
England?
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
They're not engaged.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Mom?
It's Mom.
Open the bolt!
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Daughter--I love you very much.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Do say hello to your mother.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
You're wrong.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Did you like it, dear?
He cried.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
If he thinks he's man enough.
Stop!
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
And her fiancé!
She's crying because she's so happy.
You've been bitten by bats?
You have chills?
Now who's being cruel?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I'm an honorable clown?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I see.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Jesus.
Yes.
That is sad.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Kid--kid--
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What's this?
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
What a relief!
I'll kill myself.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
I know.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
A what kind of doctor?
I was afraid to ask.
Don't know.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
He can hardly talk.
My father!
He isn't any friend of Father.
I'm touched.
Good night.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
How nice.
I'm sorry.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
She quit this afternoon.
It is?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
I'm amazed.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
That's been said before.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Is that a fact?
Not true.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
He died of a massive rupture.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
Okay.
We offer...
What girls you got here?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Um-hm. Live sound.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Ulcers.
She's dead.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Not very.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
You wife isn't dead is she?
I can't tell you that.
Andy.
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
Who made it?
Do you think she's safe?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Like what?
I just heard. Who is he?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Rucker.
Take it or leave it.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Ratan!
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
Jake.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You ever play Chicken?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Who's that?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
No.
Yes, I am.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Because if you are...
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
Do you sing and dance?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Your hearse?
Eh, fine.
Yes. Very much.
That's a nice teapot.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
Well, I really don't drink...
No more revolts.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like you, Maude.
It's so blue.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Oh.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
I have a sore throat.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Mother.
At a funeral.
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
Like a tea ceremony?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
Does that worry you?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
What else do you like?
I go to funerals.
Well, maybe one.
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
War is not all black.
Yes.
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
But wait...
It certainly is.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
What are you talking...
Finish what?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
I'm lucky that way.
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
No. It was red. Bright red.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Did he, now?
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Anung-un-Rama...
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
Goodbye.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Good night.
Alone?
Out? Out out?
I like that...
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
That you feel that way about me.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
It'll go in.
Her mother's dead.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
Who are you?
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Frank --
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Oh.
But you said --
I don't want to see the dress.
Forget him.
What happened to you?
Ssh!
You promised me an explanation.
What kind of doors?
You would be. They tore me apart.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
Yes. They'll never find us.
I don't.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
I have to see my father.
This afternoon.
So what's the argument?
We'll move in Sunday.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
Drinking alone.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
No.
I got through.
O.K.
Never better. You sleep well.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I guess.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Yes!
Not that late.
Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.
What happened to you?
Will you GO, damn you?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
You gotta be kidding me.
Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Play it.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
What are you snickering about?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Suck my ass.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
Haven't seen it.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
No, you can't.
They always seemed...
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Nothing.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Pardon me?
Nice friend.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
You look upset.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Think about it, Rob.
Hi.
-- Alright, alright but --
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
I suppose so.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Yeah.  Great.
I haven't felt like it.
Will you please just go?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
You still together?  Going all right?
You know what I mean.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Well, think about it.
Mmnn.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
You're being stupid.
Ha.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I don't know.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
It's a great song.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Yes.  You?
So you'll stay?
Right.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Whatever.
He'd want to know about all this.
Claymore.
You're the expert.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Why?
-Okay okay.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
And you?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
You've been listening to rumors.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
It's beautiful.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Of bodies.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
Come here, Brenna.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
Four?
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
What are you getting at, Moran?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
But you lived.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
We are immortal.
No!
It's like to kill me first.
And you?
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Second musketeer.
We have no understanding.
It can be different.  It must be.
He's a MacLeod.
Yes, he was.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Kahn?
Head still secure to the neck.
It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
He always did.
You're insane.
It's all we have.
Yes.
That's none of your business.
Your murder weapon?
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
Open this door!
Excuse me, I just want to --
It doesn't have to rhyme!
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
The five hundred? Sure.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Hello, Bruce...
Thank you.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
I see what you mean.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
You can break it, can't you?
What do you mean by that?
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
What's the matter?
You've got to help me, Hildy.
The insurance business?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What tickets?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Will you come here?
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Thanks.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
You know you did!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Three bullets! Any good?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
What have you got, Hildy?
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
What do I know about Williams?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
What?
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Now, Hildy --
You'll take fifty and like it!
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
No -- what?
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
First you got to sign a receipt. 
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Sure I do, Earl.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Ssh!
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Forty dollars.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
You're insane!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
Who told you that?
Bloody.
Won't they have maps?
We thought it was poison.
He's the worst liar.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
It's like telling fibs.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
They might be.
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
You need trees for an avenue.
I will if you will!
What's that?
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
How long?
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I know you mean well.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Cool.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
He left!
Yeah, come on.
That's not something to joke about.
Holy crap, thanks!
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
I don't know.
What's that?
Turn that fucking radio off!
Where ya headed?
What!
Drive through it!
That kid is one horny retard.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
I resign.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Recover any bodies?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
You said it, not me.
No, just a little too old.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
What! God damn, how many?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Well, go get her.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Hulk was dumb as shit.
And?
It's embarrassing, okay?
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Gabby, what is it?
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
My brother is discreet.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Please, honey, let me in.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Yes, and...
Why certainly!
Terrific. Can't wait!
Of course.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
That's very funny.
I love you so much.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
No.
I'm just preoccupied.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Such as what womanly things?
So he's doing okay?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila...
Even better.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
Cash.
Thought you only drank milk.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
To do what?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
Aaaahhhh!
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
A son.
Talk to me, Charlie.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Is that what you think?
How much?
What time?
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
Yeah. You must come again.
How long have you been waiting?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
No, not always.
I could always get us a bottle.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
Come here.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Mm hmm.
You got it all in your head?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
I love you.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Oh, grow up.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
That's right.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Let's go.
That is not now, human!
Yes.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Yes.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
What?
Only got one kind.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
George, you're acting very strangely.
No.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What? -- I... 
I have school.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Oh?
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
What happened?
A countdown to what?
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
They don't know this.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You try Martin?
This I can see.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Roger.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
He's my angel.
We're already over Mach 2!
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
But, Mr. President...
Above American soil?
Deploy.
Yes.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
It's war.
The Name of God...
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
An old man's dream.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Yes?
You said go between them!
How do you know?
No, Dad. You listen to me --
I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
...the solution presents itself.
Booby traps?
What about Marcus?
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
Where's my father?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
I don't like to show off.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Why?
You will go to palace there.
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
What?!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
THE WHAT?!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
Maybe he likes older women.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
What -- the bug?
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Quiet!
You've got to go to sleep now.
So now they believe me.
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
Why not.
It wasn't him.
This candid camera?
Yes.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
You said it.
Are you crazy?
Why he's argumentative?
I'll tell you what to say.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Take a left and your next right.
The man.
That's not a good idea.
Don't know.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The beach.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
You eat it.
Why not?
A girl.
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
Who, me?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Don't get too cute.
Oh come on.
Why don't you get out of my face.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
What do I do?
One of your instincts?
You have to! Quickly!
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
What exactly?
Never mind that, where are we now.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Oh no!
They can?
Yeah, sure.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Aren't we all.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
He work for us?
We met on the beach.
Join us.
What?
Do what?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Oh....Sure.
Who?
The little man in my...  ...head...
You...him...UST.
A little voice in my head.
Sir?
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Sir?
What?
...I'm looking for someone.
The poet...something he said...
Dinner...tonight.
Why?
Are you alright?
You're doing...Okay.
There's not much to tell.
Why?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
One chip?
Got to trust someone.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Beats me.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
I know the territory.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Now what?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Why?
Why did you, then?
Do something!
He told me what to do.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Why?
It will be fine. You have another.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Whoever took it does.
What's new?
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Yes, baby?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
I'll be there.
Sure.
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Maybe later.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You're exaggerating!
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
What about you, you got a crew already?
Are you sure?
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
I'm doing an interview.
Yeah.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Who is this?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
Hardly new news.
What's this?
What do you mean?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
What?
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
How much would I get paid?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
They should be.
Next to your father?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
Why?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
She's okay.
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
It acts as a drug on the body?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
That's why we hire scientists...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
After you, Doll.
Who's the pigeon?
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
No...
Uh... poetry recitation.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
We did not.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Got any symptoms?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
It's your move, Miles.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
No. I haven't. Have you?
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Thank you.
Do you want to sleep on it?
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
I don't believe you have "things."
You have to leave the house immediately!
I fell in love Miles.
You were going to have this thug...?
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Dogs?
Sometimes I forget.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Wow.
I wish I had your discipline.
Shit.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
Excuse me?
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Oh brother. Here we go.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Thank you.
Mm.
I don't know. I can assume...
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Video.
What the fuck...?
Miles -- why so angry?
-- the coin?
Mother?
Who's "Patty."
And only two are hers.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Is that his name?
Yes. Peter Warne.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why should she? After all—
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Lower the boats!
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
You talk as if—
What would you like to have me do?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
But the lady says—
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Driver!
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
You weren't so bad yourself.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Doesn't sound very exciting.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Amazing.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
A black eye. 
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Won't I ever see you again?
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Yes—if he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
But can't you wait until morning—
The dame's too smart for him.
Yeah.
Huh?
That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Mush. Mush.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Wife?
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'—you know—to make things pleasant.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
What was so appealing about Houston?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
What about Ruby?
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
No.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
No.
Who?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
Ever ask him?
It never did. 
You have other information?
Was he there often?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
That sounds fun.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
You.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
What?
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
In his inside coat pocket.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Hey, Jackie.
She knows it's my case?
Sure.
Arrest me.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
Beauty products.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
I don't think so.
Ordell pick up his bond?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
I am. Have a seat.
'74, I think.
He told me last night.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Yeah.
Surprise.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Uh-huh.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
What if he checks it?
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I hesitated taking that much.
I beg your pardon?
Do you live together?
He sells guns.
Not really.
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
Gimme one anyway.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Kinda.
Sure.
They told me.
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
I understand woman, damn!
Baby, I didn't --
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Can you cover that?
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I need to talk to you alone.
Four years?
We had done time together already.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Yeah.
No.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
You sure?
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
Yeah.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
You shot her twice?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
That's right.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
You have it with you?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
What does she do for you?
Beaumont worked for you.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
I thought you might be asleep.
All I did was walk out with it.
In a way, yes.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
Uh-huh.
Turn left.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
I was gonna tell you...
Well, how do I look?
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Well, try, huh.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
I am.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
Her knee acting up?
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Louis, you're a life saver.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I need your insight, your intuition.
What's your name?
Jacob Singer.
Whataya mean, no record?
It's freezing.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Jezzie, I can't see.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
A good lay.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Why you left.
Well, you didn't marry her.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
While you were in the shower.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
He said you didn't have one.
Jezzie?
It's so hard to believe.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Bullshit!
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
West.
Don't be funny.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Sit down!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
You know who I am.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
One drop?
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
Well that's good to know.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
If you're lucky.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
You in trouble?
Pause play.
No.
We don't have a choice!
What?
We made it?
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
You got that right.
No you don't!
Eat me.
She needs a little time.
Again?! Jesus!
He was chasing me!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Barbie from hell...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Oh shit! There he is!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Good point.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I love you.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Get him out of there!
Old Earth?
What have I done?! Idiots.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Do you see the kids?
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Florida license plate.
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
Think the tide's with us?
I can't imagine why.
You picked her up on the ferry.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
That wasn't funny.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Is anyone having this...?
You love sharks?
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Transplants?
And I'll drink to yours.
You know how I feel about her.
But you copy my work every week.
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
You know it's okay.
Mine too.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
No... I guess not.
What is your job title, exactly?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
I rock a Harmony.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Why? What the big deal?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Juno MacGuff.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Yeah, like people in love.
Thundercats are go!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
I'm pregnant.
Or stage parents!
Share the love, Tits!
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Keith's hot.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
She answered our prayers.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
How'd you meet Early?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Adele... are you serious?
Carryin' a gun.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
What'll we do out there?
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Early! Stop!!
Not so good. You sure you have to?
What do you need a Bible for?
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
...Then some.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
I don't know.
Not yet.
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
No, thanks, I can manage.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Wasn't my fault...
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Let me smell it again.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Right.
Why?
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Right.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Yeah.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
That.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Shut up.
Fifteen for me.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I had a female vagina last night.
What?
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Yeah. Come on.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Come on.
Bang up stuff.
I wouldn't believe it?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Do you care about me?
Were you protected?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
No.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I didn't bleed.
I only did it once and...
Do you know where he went?
Whah?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Making love is like.
Yeah.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
To come?
I can't man.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
How'd you get in here?
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone stand out?
Who is this?
Just a second.  Hello?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Of course not.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
What scars?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
He already did once.
Come here.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Boys.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
That has nothing to do with it.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Nothing.
Bingo.
What about prints?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
Meaning?
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
No.  I don't.
When I was very young.
Do you always open quickly?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead now.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
No.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Then why are you backing up?
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Frank told me.
I'm sure you are.
I can't.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
All the passages are guarded.
I won't leave you here.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
The new Queen lives.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
The Fortress moves?
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
What will happen?
I ache with it.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
You will not, then?
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
To the place where Death lives.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Yes, my lord.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I don't think it's working.
Would you desert your friends?
You had better manners as a pig.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Look at its insides.
He is the King.
No. He will master the leader.
Freylag's stronghold?
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
That I am, my lady.
A match for your son, I think.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
How many did you lose?
The most beautiful woman in the world.
She was not as beautiful.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Yes.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Perfect.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
What shall we do?
...Why didn't he close the window?
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Ten dollars... A month.
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Thank you.
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Twenty miles?  I see.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
You're talking to me?
Pacifica, California.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
The Gazette's small huh?
Umm, Coalville Utah.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
California.
What, come on?
Don't do this.
Oh, that's not mine.
What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
No.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
You were going to get my door.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
OK.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
OK.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
No.
That's right.
I have a 4.0.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Go to hell.
What?
Sort of.
Who could better understand than me?
I believe you! Don't worry.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Is everything okay?
About the alibi --
He chose them already?
What'd you do?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
What's the point?  Look at me.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
You know her?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
No way --
Margot!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
But maybe it's not what you think.
Maybe not to your face...
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
I can't.
What?!
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
I do.
Of course, I do!
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
Then we smash 'em?
Purely a precaution...
Always.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Like some vile toadstool.
Why have you brought me here?
Kill me... I want... so nice...
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
I didn't know... I --
It's terrible.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
No... I... I need to rest.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Track the demon to his lair.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Jack, don't!
What know you of fields of war?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
It doesn't matter.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Never.
Stop complaining.
A gentleman would offer water.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Oh, la...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
And I love you, my husband.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Ask away, sweet man.
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Only that?
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
We wait.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
It's so beautiful.
What's wrong?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
You're a good girl.
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Really?
Turn over.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
Not if what he left me was real.
We've known each other since grade school.
I flushed it down the toilet.
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
That's too long.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I didn't recognize you!
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
I'll be around to check up on you.
I'm not going!
I almost saw Catalina.
It bugs me.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I can promise you complete privacy.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
You can't make me do a thing.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
I would have killed him.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
God, you look like crap, George.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
Where have you been for a week?!
What did you do with your dog?
Money?
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
I'm married.
I don't have a phone.
What have you been before today?
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
Going on?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
You've never said that before.
I need to know.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Does Alyssa know?
I wasn't sure.
Who?
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
We should take a vacation.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Take it off.
Can you stay for dinner?
Dad said it first.
Someone stop her!
Dad's home, already?
Better make it a week.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah...
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
I'll be right back.
Goodnight, Claude.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Claude Banks.
Good old Monroe.
Nothing.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
He even got my daddy's watch.
What ain't there?
Winston. His name's Winston.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
So?
Forget it.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Yeah.
Does that mean I'm in?
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
I'm not working on a plan.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
It's too late for plans.
Why the hell not?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
You killed Santa Claus?
Why ain't that pick swinging?
You heard the boss! Let's move!
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
They gave me life, mama.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
Blacks welcome there?
I hear a train coming. Drink.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
I'm calling you out, brother...
It would be so okay.
No.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
That pain is hunger.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
I'll just go to Heaven.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
The South.
If you want to.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Yes...
From my dad's side of the family.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
I feel sorry for you, boy!
It'll be all right...
We're ready.
And I did it myself right on there.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Not in my time...
Well... you can't have them all.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Did you?
Why did you do that???!!!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
No.  Just no.
Well then...?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
I changed my mind.
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
I'm afraid to tell you.
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
Six. I go red next year.
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
You're sure you don't want to try?
All right.
I let him go... believe me.
I don't..
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Of course.
It could be...
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
To what?
Yes...
No.
What's that?
Do you want to see Doc?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
Gracious... no.
Not yet.
All right.
Can you make it back?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Okay.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Ours, Ed.
Yeah, I remember.
Can I call you?
I can't see you tonight.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Yes.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Yes.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
No, nothing.
Same one you were reading the other night?
What?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
What job?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
All right!
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
What'd I tell ya.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
I don't want to talk about it...
I do like you, Sheila.
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes, sir.
Don't call me brother.
I see.
Is it?
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
No kidding?
Yes.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
Sounds like a stall to me.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Come on, Lovey.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
I'll say.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Who, for instance?
Centuries.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No porters here!!
Yes.
Oh, I'm so glad.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Sondra Bizet.
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
What are you talking about?
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Porters?
Shhh!
You can't leave, George.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
Where are we going? Huh?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
My name's Sondra.
hope you'll forgive me for—
A man whose life was empty!
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
You'll wait till you rot!
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Sir, you can't just--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Um-- Kay?
Let's check am out.
Hold it.
There's a god damn good reason.
And what's this ... ?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
You think that's what's-happening?
I think that's what's happening...
What if he's telling the truth?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
Right.  Oh, and here.
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Why not?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Wait-- listen--
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Dee?  What are you doing here?
Did it leave?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
What?
Forget that guy --
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Anne Lively...
Yeah --
I can't even stand up --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Don't worry, Lamar.
Uh-huh...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Hang on, Lamar --
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Don't apologize, John.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
You're kidding, that's today?
I show a cop on horseback.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Run the subscription list...
The mall?
Did he close the front door?
We're in motion on something.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
She said...
I need your help.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I forgive you...
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm a little dizzy...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Heal who?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
He's dead, Lara.
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
We know why John was tagged.
Lamar --
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
How many?
Yes.
That was our apartment.
To what?  Trap him?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
What's 'incidentals?'
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
I can take you down there.
Not on me, sir.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
Should I fuck him?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Chloe?
Uncle Bobby?
I don't know.
I love you. Come home.
Yeah? You sure?
I want you to quit.
Yeah.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
How so?
Why?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They were out of line --
What?
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yes. Goodbye.
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Nah.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Thanks.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Bullshit...
I'll beat your ass --
Fuck him.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
I like it.
How'd you unlock my phone?
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Nah, don't bother --
Oh, I'll represent alright.
C'mon, man...
Great. On my fucking room.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
How'd they know who you were?
What the fuck do you...
You too?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
The what?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
No.
Three and a half hours?
Where do you get this shit?
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Bobby and Ricky.
Ugh...
The videos.
It means you got a gun?
Stop.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Come, now. You just got here.
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
What?
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Where I come from. Boston.
Man's rep travels.
How 'bout that?
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
I'm working on it.
What you talking?
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
I don't want your money.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
What for?
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
What?
What have you set your mind to?
Talk about what?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Let's cancel.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
Just what is your question?
Just what are you saying?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Entirely.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Yes, sir, I did.
"His greatest greatness."
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Did you hear me?!
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
500.
Please make way, please --
How long has this been going on?
...That isn't a whore?
Me?
Fine as May wine.
I ain't doing bad.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
So you are going to talk me to death.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
It's a little late.
I'll call you tomorrow.
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[I want you.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Her life for your life.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[Lucky how?]
[And?]
[You stole the drop.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
Show me, please.
It's loaded.
How does it affect you?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Creasy...
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
But why not?
So you were unhappy?
I go to school, don't I?
Yes.
In a week you should be fine.
You feel sorry for the husband?
I know you're not.
Still not a question.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Planned what?
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Last night. Do you know something?
For a year?
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
You do?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
You helped him get this job.
Which one was that?
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I could see she likes you.
Where?
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
I came to see you. How you feel?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Catherine, my sister...
Marty.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
I don't.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Nothing.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Nothing.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Oh, that's a sad story.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
I heard you, Ma.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
Well...
On accounta...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Sure, sure.
I don't wanna talk about it!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
They give you copies to burn.
No.  Or why you should.
Pour one for Painless.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Duke Forrest.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Sixteen times.
What do you think, Trapper?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
What?
I think I heard about that.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
That's right. We work well together.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Very happily married.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
Yeah!
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
What's the story?
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Boys, we're home free.
Are you all right?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
About me?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Yes, sir.
Thirty dollars.
The Websters!
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Huh?
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
What's that?
There is no letter. I made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
In what man!
Who, for instance?
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Oh!
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Has he been here?
I ain't seen him for a week.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Yeah, a little.
I used to pitch.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Go out and find her!
Shut up!
Look!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Naw.
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
It must be some kind of a gag.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Well?
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Why—uh—
Yes. Sure.
How?
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
What difference does that make?
Did you write it—or didn't you?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
Oh!
Good night, John.
Uh-huh.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
Racket? What do you mean?
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
I don't know.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
Dinner's on you.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
You want me to go up with you?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
For now that's all.
Only at the very end.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
I'm not sure.
So what do I say to this guy?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
You're crazy.
So what do you want to do?
Only that floor.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Scottie...
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Prude.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Roper...
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Wake up?!
From the dream.
You are not a God.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
It's his nature.
-- He will.
How long?
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
And you weren't involved.
What?
The truth.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Times Square.
Her?
For what?
Yes.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
There?
-- Standard.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
It will not harm you.
I've never been this sore in my life.
What does that mean?!
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
I think so.
We can take these guys!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Wait for me!
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Activating Power Scope!
But I've never served a day.
Tell me about it.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Scared.
Long as Charlie says.
That ain't what your mama said.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I was calling yesterday.
But there's...
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
It'll just be a few minutes.
What's your problem?
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
What the fuck does that mean?
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
You get fifteen percent.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Spare us.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Come on. Be polite.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Thank me next time you see me.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Tell me what?
He called me "Doc."
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
All right. You can come.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Really?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
This way?
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Forty-five all total.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Where's the Majority Leader?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Looks like it, but--
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Okay. You don't mind?
I'll cherish ya.
No.
We're gonna get married.
You said it!
Right now--everything I own--!
You know, we're getting married.
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Sam Foley--dead!
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
The--head?
What stuff?
The porter's got them. They're coming.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
For a question!
Thank you, sir.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Yes, I was--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Fine--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Why?
What's that?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Pardon?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
I did--and--and I got right up.
No.
Go right ahead.
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Abigail.
No!
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
Great.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Wow!
I'm not.
That's what I said--the *truth*!
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Well! You don't say!
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
"So help me God."
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Swell!
Well--I have got *one* idea--
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Go away, Nosey.
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Do I actually *see* this--?
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, sir.
Next, please.
No.
No!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Now, what do you see?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Nothing—
You have?
Yeah, I know.
He did?
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
You threw them out!
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
You're acting like a school girl.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Sure.
Yes.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
You're crazy! You can't do that!
That's the rub.
Shhh!
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Me sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
Let me go!
What was that you said he was?
Mr. Cedar!
Hang up.
All set.
No, thank you.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
No, thanks.
What're you talking about?
Oh.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Shut up!
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
We own an opera house, don't we?
Why not?
Uh-huh.
It takes so long to detect them—  —because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
Oh, Mr. Deeds—
What kind of wife did you say she was?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Who?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Were you supposed to have a session?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
My approach?
What kind of doubts?
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Why not?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
No?
I didn't hear you.
Now we're back on track.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
Yes.
Oh?
What are they?
You do?
It was Henry Follett.
You like me. How come?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
No.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
What?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's what I like.
Transference.
Which show was that?
Have women found you attractive?
That's not quite what I said --
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
All new people start with that...
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Yep.
When?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
What is he doing here?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
Twenty.
No.
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
It's everybody's problem!
I think you were jealous
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
I think you found something.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
You lied to me!
Awfully.
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
I know you did.
Um-hmm.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
So who killed him?
I was eight.
I'm the Bowler.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Are you with me... or against me?
Date?
Why?
It is?
What?
Bye. 
When I am sure I am among friends.
LOOK!
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
But there's still only six of us.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Who's chicken? 
See ya tomorrow.
Wait!... Look!
Shhh.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Oh hi, Mom.
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Shut up.
Great timing!
Proceed.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Proceed.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Please...
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
But who made this treaty?
Come in.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Have you been back recently?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
What is that?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
And he sent you to me?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Does your mother know you have come?
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Lisette.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
I know of no better time.
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Do you expect me to believe that?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were you in love with any of them?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Promise me.
Promises mean nothing.
All right -- I promise.
Goodbye.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Why not?
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
What was there to tell?
How do you know?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
That is correct.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Can I look for myself?
Black magic.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Damn, you got a stalker.
That ain't gonna work.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Hold on.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I don't play for no team.
All damn.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
I'll remember.
Nothing.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
20 minutes?
What?!
What urgent message?
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Huh?
Nothing.  What you want?
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Yes?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
What?
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
You...
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
No way.
No, kisses to...
Oh, man...
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I see. Where is this gun?
Why?
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Young love.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
You understand?
Yes! Yes!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
I'll be switched!...
Come on!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
'Cause you're too little.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
No. No.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Under the stone in the floor.
What secret shall I tell?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Can I have my supper please?
Why, pray tell?
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
The first night?
She turned me out of the bed.
Harry, what --
I -- no, I --
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Get the kit!
Because he was scary, that's why.
Who was scary?
No.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Used to. Not anymore.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
You know he's dead though, right?
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
I don't mean her --
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Go on...
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
Of course. What's that?
No more fights.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
You should. I'll show you.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
I can tell you exactly.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
That's right.
I think I need my glasses.
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Count d'Algout...
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Comrade Kopalski...
A week?
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
What business?
You believe in our cause?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
I must get into that country of yours!
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
I don't have to but I find it natural.
I'll try.
Go ahead.
Yes, it is.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
He takes good care of that.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
No, that was restful. Again.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
I don't like your following me.
Must one always be after something?
Just smile.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I don't think so.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
No... go on.
My darling.
You must, darling.
Yes... a little white house.
No! No!
Radio! What is radio?
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now, Swana...
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Oh, yes.
That bad?  Old or young?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
What is this, Swana?
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
I must insist that you leave.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
Unfortunately.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Go on.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
May I ask what has happened?
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
The future of the common people.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
... go on.
'Night, Al.
For what?!
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
Lincoln used it.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
What's Liddy got?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
What'd you say?
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Yes ...
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
I always get my man.
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
Yeah ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Of course.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Sir?
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
Sir?
No, sir ...
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
It's over, Dick.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
You're a long way from Whittier.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Someday, Dick.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How you been, Ellis?
'Predate it.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
It could be.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
You gonna drive out there?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Hyah!
Don't hurt no one.
I put it in, Mama.
I ain't got the money.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Yes. Things fall into place.
What're you doin', baby?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Well -- how come?
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
You expect him?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I don't know.
Nobody. Accounting.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
With what?
Sir?
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Sir?
Just call it.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
All right. Heads then.
Sir?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
What kind of tent?
You on all night?
When did you last see him.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
That's not an answer.
Half.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Took me about three hours.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Cast iron?
Pot metal?
Were you in Nam?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
No I don't have it.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I got an overcoat on.
Yes sir.
Nam?
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
...I meant your food.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Did you send anyone out there?
Bad idea...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Yeah?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
You're lying!
We think we know where Betty is.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
...what're you saying?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
I gotta go make dinner.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
You told me that two hours ago.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
He has a wife?!
HE IS REAL!!
He is real.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Good.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Ahh... my wife's.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Hell of a way to die.
IT SURE IS!!
Well, why'd you shoot him?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Wesley...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
You made your point...  I was wrong.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Betty was a lovely child.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Better.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
She's a lesbian.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Fire! I hate fire!
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
Problem a p'seption.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
No, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
How're you doing, Sarge?
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
No, sir.
Where are you from, boy?
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Is your brother a flyer?
Yeah.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
It sure was.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
So?
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
Yeah. All week long.
I've seen better.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Not with me.  Not with people.
She didn't.
Yes.
This is ridiculous...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
You got an idea?
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Keep your voice down.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Shit!
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
You don't look so good.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
It's just the woman and the kid?
No fucking way.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Fuck her too.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
What if they get in here?
Feel okay?
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
On it!
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He --
I'm sorry.
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
What are you doing with the gun?
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
You know it. Stay Black...
Look this is bull...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
No man. PE -- "political education."
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Jesus...
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
Yes sir, I did.
We're like policing the police.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Maybe...
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
What?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Thank you.
You couldn't have known.
I know that.
Of course, I do.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Not yet.  What happened?
I have no choice, I...
I didn't see any.
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
Granted.  Where are you going?
I know.
That's a damn long time...
And your principles?
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
I hope so.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Quiet.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
That's enough, Ellen.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Allman Brothers.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
You're telling me.
This time I mean it.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
Nope. He's your cat now.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
I got eggs down here!
I will.
You can't.  I can.
That's right.
I'll watch my back.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
What?
I know where your heart truly lies.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Yes, father.
Yes -- yes.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
The trees are taller.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
And you've got that, have you?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
I don't think that will be necessary.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
Because you're a pirate.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
This way!
It's the right way.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
My apologies, Governor.
No, thank you.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Okay.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
So, I guess it worked.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
The nanobot.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
That was 'simple'?
No, why?
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
What did you want my hair for?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
Yes.
God, what a fight that was.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
Yeah, and what might that be?
It's a miracle.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Dexter.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
How-di-do.
I'm glad.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Your house?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know—
Huh?
We were classmates.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
A what?
My play.
Araby?
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes sir!
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
It's the smoke.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Nothing.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Been where?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
I have it here.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Get out of here.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
A bird in a gilded cage?
Very good, sir.
Thanks.
Ah.
Sure.
Yes she is.
I don't know.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
All night?
What's the matter?
She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
No. What?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
... How?
Thank you very much.
No. Of course not.
Yes I do.
Okay--that's enough!
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
Just take deep breaths.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
Play along?
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
Well if I don't who will?
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
It's fine.
Nothing?
... Yeah.
... Lover's Lane?
Yeah.
Hunh?
I'm not sure.
Ooomph?
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
COME BACK!!!
I can't.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Why?
Just gimme the damn remote!
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Listen to me!
Just listen to me ...
Forget about that!
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
So they can have their hamburgers!
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Really?
Aren't you a little early?
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
What happened?
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
That's it.
Somewhere in Utah.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I have no idea.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Nothing.
It doesn't matter.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You don't even know how much it is.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
....what....?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
....this is your mistake....
No.
They're not open yet?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah, not really.
Are you guys hurt?
Alright?
You like her?
Yeah.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
So that was your pudding?
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
What did he want?
...yes I did...?
Yes no not really.
Hi.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
About six months ago. Why?
yeah.
I think maybe over a hundred.
I thought that you were anyway.
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
I cut myself.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Yes it is.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
And your name?
It's ok, take your time.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
Thank you.
That was weird. I meant good.
Mhm.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I know.
Seriously.
You can't be late though.
I know.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
What did you say?
Put him through.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Now give the signal.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
It's not even noon --
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Don't be so sure.
Do I have your word?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.

Of course.

For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
No. It most certainly was not.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
What's that then?
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?

Ok, champ.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
And where you goin'?
Nothing...
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Yeah --
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
You wasn't with her, were you?
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
C'mon, Joey.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
At night?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I just wanted to say hello.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
Do what I say.
Now take your panties off.
Positive.
What did I do?
All I did...
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
With Salvy, eh?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Why don't you just call him?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Never felt better.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
Thanks.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Ever get an answer?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Like an old hambone?
Congratulations, Jeff.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Why should I?
No.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Isn't he a salesman?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Get back there! He'll see you!
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's probably one in the basement.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
How much do you think you'll need?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Anything else bothering you?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Yes.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
You mean "goodnight."
I mean what I said.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Now, Lisa --
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
What are you getting at?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
What's the apartment house number?
What about it?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Still -- those witnesses.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
How'd he get in?
I think I should go home.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
That's funny!
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
You what?
Well--
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
Sure.  Sure.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Just relax, please relax!
What's that pounding?
Head-shrinker?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
We know.
Help me in!
Man, you're schizoid!
When was that?
Who?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Why?
They like you.  Okay?
Just a guard.
And you wanted him to make a list!
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Wash up and go home.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
I don't know why--!
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
Pretty mixed up?
Chicken?
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Now that's true!
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Who lives?
See, I'm new.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Yeah--why--
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
There's just one thing.  What about--
Are you?
Hi.
Do you think your father means that?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You said you'd call my father.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel, what are you doing!
What are you doing here?!
To all those cons...
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Yes it was all you --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
I love you!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
...maybe I die for Nick...
What?
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
I love you, Nick...
We'll need one.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I shared his cell!
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
What college.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
You do.
I'm gonna need some money.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
I'm no threat without a gun.
Ash?
He's not Nick Mason...
OPEN IT!!!
Mr. Bangs.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Oh, man --
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Alamo...
No, man! No, no, no!
You're hitting for MY cards!
They changed the layout.
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
...What bar?
Yeah.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
What for?
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
It's a change.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Nope.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Down to my car.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Bet your sweet ass we are.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
Uh-uh, just cops.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
That was the plan, we meet here.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
We don't think this place is safe.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Yeah, those guys too.
Maybe he did.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Will she be dark or fair?
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Maybe they will.
I don't want to run short.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
And meet him there.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
There's only two of them now.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
Don't act so -- crazy.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Well, say it.
There aren't any women here.
And you're all alone.
Depends on how good you drive.
And we're running out of that.
How many ways can a man say no.
Where is he?
Put on another one.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Then I know my alphabet.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Steve --
If you need me, I'll be --
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey, I have an idea...
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Alright!
It looks like the furnace.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
I don't need your help.
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Huh?
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Are you?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Got my camera right here.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Would you please focus?
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Alright, go to the belt store...
It's okay. I understand.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
What?
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
"Fucked me."
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Oh Mom...
You scared me.
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
You bitch!
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
COCKSUCKER! 
So you admit you just lied?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
I do, please.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Yes you are.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
Yes, I understand.
What sort of danger?
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
I can't understand it at all.
"The Dante?"
She's a pretty good sort.
No. She asked about the trademark.
A job?
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
Yes.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
What things? Why?
I don't know.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Not from me.
No!
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I have something even better.
Devil worshippers!
I have to go —-
They may have been friends of hers.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
Yes. When I tell you.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
I think it's time.
It might have.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I don't believe it.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
False alarm.
Curious.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Lawyers.
How do you mean?
I feel like they do.
Why is that?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Impotent.
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Not really.
All of these are interviews?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Maybe you want to go.
Yes.
She said it on her tape.
Why not?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What difference does it make why I do it?
I have money.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
Why not?
That's correct.
And now you can?
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
And you feel the same way with John?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Because.
I can't tell you like this.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Mmmmm...
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Why don't I believe you?
Always the lawyer.
Loud.
Yes.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
No, I haven't.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
I guess.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And... do whatever it is you do.
I just thought it might --
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Well, what, then?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Why did you do that?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I can't believe you did that!!
I don't want to discuss it.
What is it?
Hold on.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I just want to know why you're here.
How did you find me?
You just want to ask me questions?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Do you like the way I look?
Okay.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Maybe.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
I know. Will you please leave now?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You were prying before?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
So is my wife, asshole!!
No.
No.
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
No. Dotty's the last.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Gonna cut me open?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
OK. I'll think about it.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Home?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Who trusts experts?
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Are you spoken for this evening?
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
Sure thing.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
Well, then put him at the singles table.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Bye.
Bye.
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Stephanie.
Nice.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Good. How're you?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
I am one of those guys.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
It does. Feels right.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
I will.  See ya!
Yeah.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Put me down, Jack.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
What the fuck!
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Hey.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Yeah. Thanks.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Good. So did I.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
You too.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
So how're you doing?
So what's happening with your book?
About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About a year.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Oops. Sorry.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
A hair.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
I'm here.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
No I'm not.
What time is it?
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Yes.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Bimboo?
I just asked his name.
Don't call me Father.
Sorry.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
They think it might happen all at once.
Don't worry.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
No money, eh?
It was my fault.
They've been kind to me.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I haven't done anything.
It's a town...
Women?
I'll be around.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
What's that?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
He is now.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
What makes you think I could?
I heard that too.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
I thought we talked about that.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
You like a good saloon?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
"Forever".
She'll drive herself.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
I do?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I just read somewhere --
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Hello, is this Elaine?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
For her?
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Not like this --
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
I don't know anything about computers.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
She still with Kent?
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
She can't watch herself.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Night, Lainey.
Really?  Too bad.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
She did... didn't she?
I could get the death penalty.
An insanity defence.
-- I bet you have.
This should take care of Mother.
I don't understand.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
You could play the lead.
The only real truth is in the work.
No, just one.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
Why?
That I'm a freak.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What?
They don't know they're dead?
I told you what I want.
When?
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
You believe me, right?
Are you wigging out?
I guess she did.
Really?
What?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
Dead people.
Got it.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
Like what?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
What's a "little while?"
The band.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
I'll be fine here.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Yeah?
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Look. You want to talk about this?
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
It's you. You and your father.
Suzie --
No. Not without you --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
That wasn't a good night, no.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
Yeah. Good.
Shelby!
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Yeah.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Okay.
You know how rumors start.
But you could get killed, right?
Eyes on the road.
They're both a challenge.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Ciao.
Ummm?
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Absolutely.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Let's keep it that way.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I ran into complications.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Yeah, but...
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
That's correct.
What kind of personnel?
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Yeah.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Mmm-hmm.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Your attitude sucks.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
My debrief --
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...So you made another deal?
-- okay, g'head --
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Wow.
No shit.
None whatsoever.
-- never in a million girl --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Got hit twice.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
Listen --
Whose side are you on?
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Maybe you can.
I wasn't.
Stop it.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
You still don't believe in God?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I did too.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
Rheya --
You should have told me.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
But then I would be dead now.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Could be, I guess.
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
You asked.
You could do better.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
They called here after you left...
What do you want to do?
Let's do it.
... Don't explain.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Sure we are, let's go!
Too kinky.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
My ass is falling.  It is.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
You don't want to hear about it.
I might stop you.
It's not your taste.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Why?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
I'll be right up.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
You heard me.
What're you talking about --
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
What about when she identifies him?!
I heard.
... Hard?
Why should she come in?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Mom and I got plans.
She's what?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I hate--
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Hi, Adele.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
I know him.
I'll introduce you.
Use a fork.
See?  You big dullard.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
I'll try. Thanks.
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Bonkers.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
I'm not so happy myself.
Is you all good Nazis?
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Which one of you is what?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
Let's!
What is your number?
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Interesting.
You should live so long.
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
What's the award?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
You're crying, Animal.
Why, sure!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Why the south latrine?
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Are we boring you?
Says me.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
What's the decoy?
Shoot!
Nothing for Kuzawa?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Not particularly.
Where is he?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
Thanks.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
It's our pleasure.
Please, please.
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
What do you want?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No, sir.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Execute!
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Nothing. As before.
Aye, sir.
What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
David... Sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Not exactly.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I still don't...
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
What's wrong?
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Wait! Give me a chance --
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
Success, my lord.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
They know we would die first.
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
I have my orders.
Is that a poem?
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
What do you want with us? I demand --
Let them eat static.
Locking phasers on target.
Raise them --
Rake her.
Chekov, who is this man?
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
He'll die -- !
Admiral, this is Spock.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Best speed, Scotty...
Spock...!
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
I did not think so.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Engine room! What's happening?!
Understood, sir.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Engage warp engines --
Visual.
Phasers locked...
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Yeah.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Why don't I?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Please...
It'll come back to him.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
We've done it before.
That's crazy!
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Name?
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
Can you protect us?
We are launching everything we have.
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
All right. The truth?
You want the details?
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Yes?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
What is our condition?
Three-one-zero, aye!
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Picture, Uhura!
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
On screen.
Humpbacked - people.?
Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
On my way...!
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Millions?
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
You're what?
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Androids... don't have...fun.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Yes. But look at this medscan...
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
Another time.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
It is not over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Eject the core.
The purpose being...?
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Gorch?
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Good question.
What you're doing to my neck...
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I'm not sleeping well...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
There should be some kind of manual release...
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
What's still there?
I'm on it...
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
There's a few of us left.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
No... I'm from France.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Steady as she goes.
Life signs?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
I'll keep that in mind.
What are you suggesting?
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
I'm not sure how to take that.
I beg your pardon?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Shields up. Battle stations.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Thank you, Captain.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
They'll be here...
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Krandog aranty.
Aye, sir.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
You hear that?
Sulu!
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
I am uncertain.
Where?
The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
Who else?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
What?
What's left of it.
That could take hours!
I know precisely where he'll be.
Aye, aye, sir.
What exactly does that mean?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Is that your final answer?
Why?
Is he very much like you were?
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Sorry, sir.
Good work. The download?
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Why?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Thank you.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
No!
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
On screen.

I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
If you don't mind.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
It's working.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Anything.
And the Senate supports you?
I know.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
No race should be a slave to another.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
I know.
Why are you here?
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Do as I tell you!
A matter of hours now.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
Now go. I have some personal business.
Probably kids.
Have a nice trip.
I make maps.
No.
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
It is beautiful.
He's got a gun!!
Stay right there...
Elmo's...
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Dashboard.
Flashlight.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
Candy.
I...
You want to try it?
You better.
Yes.
Yes. Day... night.
Do you have a baby?
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Can I have the gun?
Goodbye.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
I don't know.
That was beautiful.
I feel better if I move.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
No.
Yes, they are.
I'd like to...
Goodbye.
Call the police!!
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Yeah, right.
You're going down.
My God.
Tonight.
Maybe.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
We should talk alone.
No.  Mace is in this.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
But this is a bad one.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
I won't say anything.
Naawww.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Strickland.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Sleaze to peddle.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Coming with you.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So that gives you something.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
Well, look at the plus side.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
No.  Trust me.
Are you going to make me beg?
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
That's right, Jan.
You're thinking...?
This isn't in our database?
I have 6 tons.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Yes.
He had an orange hat on.
What kind?
At the field office.
Speck. Harold Speck.
Its called insubordination.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
I was visiting an old college friend.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
How long have you been downtown?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
You want to have dinner?
They're all criminals?
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He thinks he looks young.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
Huh?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
I know.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Yes.
How's the arm?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
Who told you about her?
Yeah.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[You tell me.]
What did you do to end up here?
I screwed up twice, sir.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
I don't...
I talked to him.
Murman!
Shuddup.
Shut up.
Oh... a Cavalier.
I like quiche.
Yeah.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Anything?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
You want this in black chips.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Yeah. And an actor.
...It's really getting late.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
Lorraine?
Yeah, hold on.
You know, us.
Why didn't you call?
It's definitely a step back for me.
What do you want? You're tall.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Bud.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
I got to at least try once.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
Sure.
So, what? Eleven?
Damned if I know...
Not well.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
...People get carjacked...
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas!
She smiled baby.
It doesn't matter...
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Always.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
What an asshole.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
She smiled, baby.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
I don't know...
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Baby, you did fine.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Hold on.
She thought you were money.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
...It looked money.
Minnie Pearl.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
No.
See, baby?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...You're just poking at it...
You're money.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
...it's on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...Definitely...
Be smart about it.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
The Court gave you justice.
But your daughter is still alive.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
You have to answer for Santino.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Yeah.
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
Are you worried about security for your million?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
You understand him better than anyone.
And with prison record.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
Yes.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
How?
Godfather, you understand everything.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Beautiful all over, eh?
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Give them some money and send them home.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
Can you do it Mike?
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Right.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
Huh?
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
To the city.
He talked to you?
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming. 
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
No, I like him.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
No!
Is Freddie here?
Tom, I don't love you.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
I'm well, thank you.
Yes it is.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
I hope she never knows.
What's going on?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Bird. That's jazz.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
I think you're right.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Why? When?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Excuse me?
Hello.
Emily.  Just kidding.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
What?
I've thought about you.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
I can't later.
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
It's okay.
He says so many fiancées.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Nah, this'll be fine.
They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first.  You got anything to carry these in? 
Yes, mam.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Really?
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
You must be rich.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
You forgot "sexy".
More people watch it.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
This is gotta be a game, right?
Ouch!
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
The kind with a brush.
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
For a fee.
Where.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
What's your real name?
What's your real name?
Oh, come off it, man.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Can I see you again?
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Why not?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Cops don't do nothin.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
Yes I am.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
There must be something...
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Slow.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
I know.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
What, vou?
It's about time.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
I am, too.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
I don't smoke?
My what?
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes, sir.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
No, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Go ahead, son.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Why?
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
Yes?
Did you... did you...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Vultures...
Zackly.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
She's very pretty.
Huh?
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
I... I don't believe this.
I was decorated.
Exactly.
So, it is a blacklist.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
No thanks.
Not any more.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
What do you mean?
Some of it might come back to you.
Oh.
The customers?  I don't know...
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Yes?
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you.
Yes?
All right. 
Where are you from originally, Annie?
I suspected as much.
She already has a daughter.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I did.
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Where does he live?
Where?
See them two big trees across there?
The two kids?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Okay.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
We'll make our own fog.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
How long have you known her?
She was selling birds.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I got them all, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
When?
But they'll be back.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
No.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Well, I...
Oh.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Yes.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Seven o'clock then.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Yes, but...
I told you what happened in Rome!
What do you want ?
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Yes.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
It's an uprising.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
Of course I will.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
Pulse?
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Not yet.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
No.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
The heart pumps it.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
I was talking about you.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
You killed my daughter.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
He said he'd prove it.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
No foolin'? Will you?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
Well, we could--
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
What about him?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
No -- no, thanks.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
But I suppose you know the answer.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
Zero.
What's goin' on, Marko?
No.  Stick around.
I told Max eight o'clock.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
Who, Laddie?
I like Michael.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll pass.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
I thought we were poor.
Not that poor.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
But, Mom...
No, I'm not...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Lucy.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
What do you mean?
Okay.
Why not?
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
The Marines.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
So what's our problem?
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Well, go on.
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Well, get to it.
Well, stick to it.
He's dead.
Why?
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
He's one of them.
When do you think it got to him?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
What kind of stories?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
How did you know?!
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Last night.
It was meant to.
What do you mean?
I won't leave you like this.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I -- what are you?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
Trust me...
Talk away, Professor.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
So it's astronomy now, is it?
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
You sound like my father...
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
Hiding?
You wouldn't believe me.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
What makes you say that?
Why not?
Why would you do that?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
If you only knew...
Mara --
No!
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Here?
Might I ask why?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Why?
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
My business?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
I don't understand...
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Our car won't start.
[Beat] What's your name?
Well, you belong in one.
How?
Please...
After I...
I know.
I don't know.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not.
[Beat, lost] No.
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
Good. How's your mom?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
The future doesn't look different?
Maybe.
Why not?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Becker does? Are you sure?
Why "of course"?
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Yup. That's me.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
What?!
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Maybe.
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
I'm choking on it.
Oh yeah.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Yeah!
Maybe.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Yes!  I believe I am!
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Let's get it over with.
Now what what?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
We should have just ignored him.
Shoot the radio!
Just asking.
I said all that?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
We can live in a hacienda.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
We've gone insane.
Why?
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You got that right.
Say you're sorry.
Grrrreat!
The thing's kind of heavy.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Good-looking?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Well think about it.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Hm?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Am I?
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
You found my car?!
Yep.
Ahh.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- He's in a cage?!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
How about -- ?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Lint?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
What?
Warren!
Uh-huh.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
No, not at all.
Nope. Never been.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Uh, that's okay.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Do what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Harvard?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
You were following us?
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
I wish.
Shhhhhh!
What?! No please, sir --
Teddy, be brave.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Eh.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Tomorrow...
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Then they should speak up.
You know I don't mean they're weak.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
An invasion...
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
I, uh...
What about you? Where are you going?
Not as far as the election goes.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Jesus Christ...
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Don't get too attached.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
A murder. On the reservation.
Goodbye.
Who the fuck is he?
Beats the hell outta me.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
She's that subtle?
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
And...
A what?
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
What you call myths, we call our history.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Move it, Magdelana.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
I could be, too.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Where were you?
Two meters.
You let me make a fool of myself.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
And far too aggressive.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Used to what?
I'm starting to sense that now.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
What?
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
. Yeah!
What?
What truth?
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
That's three.
Who's gonna win?
I hope you find him.
Yes sir.
What is he doing?
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
NO. NO GOOD.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
I know!
Okay.
The plane is fine.
Any more MiGs?
Why do they call you Wolf?
On what?
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
Don't.
Skipper, you can't do this!
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
Figured out what?
Yes sir.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
You may not think so, but you are.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Identification?
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Yes, sir.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Swallow this.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Relax, you'll live longer.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Move to Mars.
And you believe him?
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Why would I lie to you?
Don't be ridiculous.
Get out!
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Oh, since when?
You two-faced-bastard.
What?
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
No problem.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
No.  We go straight.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
You got <u>that</u> right!
I think we wait right here.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
You bet.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Let's assume that it is.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
And one good guy.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Absolutely.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
I have to talk to your brother.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Sustained.
-- With objection!
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
No. No...
Of course.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
But what?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
What's Art Esparza?
...For ten years, now.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I haven't paid you.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
It's okay, Eddie.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
See-cil.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
-- Eddie told you?
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
-- Roger --
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
NO! GOD, NO...
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Here he comes.
What was?
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Well, where are you going?
Can you tell me what their names were?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
No you couldn't.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
OK, Gordon.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
Sorry to hear it.
Say no more.
Thanks.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Faulty wiring.
Noooo...
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Call me.
No, I want to smoke.
No, you're the muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Nothing.
I did? I didn't see anything.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I already made you two tapes.
I am The Muffin.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
This afternoon?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Dad...
No.
We're late to get to your mother.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Stay away from me.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
What is the truth?
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
You know what that would mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
That's not my handwriting.
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
No.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
You may step down.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Tell us.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
We just...
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... um...
Why is that?
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
Hi. How are you doing?
Yes.
What did she say?
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Mr. Concannon...?
That's what I am.
No.
I can't guarantee that...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
No.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Then why don't you testify?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
Yes.
Yeah.
...now who is that...?
What?
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I'm going to get laid.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
They still have to take it to a jury.
Oh shit, what's today?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
That's right.
...one of the other nurses?
The 'History'...?
I just saw her.
We, we were rather busy...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
What's he like?
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
Right.
So is the town, I notice!
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
And I...I've got other things happening.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Chase, you'd better come home.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Bye.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I'm fine.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Yeah...how'd you know?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
You really think Dylan's okay?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Coffee'd be nice.
Not yet.
We were idealists.
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Thank you.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
We all have problems.
But that's not the point...
Yes.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Speak up boy!
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
He killed the dolphin.
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
He's a big boy.
I can take care of myself.
Yes.  I do.
You're officer of the watch, George.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
What's that?
Why would you do that?
Why'd you jump?
I couldn't do it.
Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
I figured it out.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
It seems we're short on singers.
What?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Son of a bitch!!
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Why? He's right in the groove.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
No way... GET OUT!!!
Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...
No, haven't heard of it.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Forty bucks...
Used to.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
That bastard Pucinski...
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
You won't of missed much.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
And you never told nobody about it?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You up for that?
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
It's just another case, Sailor.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
You do.
Who knows, baby?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
It's a comfortin' idea.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Uh-huh?
What could I be up to, Lula?
What?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Shoot him.
In the head.
Yes.
Through the forehead?
On one condition...
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
What?
By who?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Life is unpredictable.
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
She's a transvestite.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
He heard everything we were saying.
Just go around him.
Tripp, where the hell...
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
His parents.
Maybe... I don't know.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
What's to tell?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Such as.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
I peeked.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Right.
I had to. Didn't I?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
How did I get here last night?
Well done, James.
The bus station.
Who?
No.
Jesus, James. Wow.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Kinship. And what's here?
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
In a minute. Get us a table.
Okay.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Even if I end up going to jail....
Just checking.
I thank you.
Do?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
It beats 'What's your major?'
That good, huh?
I got the message you called.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Simple.
Hm.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
Did you confess?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
James Leer.
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
And the jacket?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
He told me.
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh?
I'm your man.
I'm not sure that's possible.
What's that?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Ah, right. The book.
That's weird.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
Yeah. It's really nice.
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
It's not what you think.
Sure.
That was terrific.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Cop.
Why don't you just tell me?
I could get a search warrant.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
I fell asleep.
The girl.
I'd say you're moving.
I count my blessings.
I'm adjusting okay.
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
It's all the same.
What?
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
No fucking way.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Forget it.
Is that what you are angry about?
How do they know?
Fuck you, Rosen!
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
What?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
How old are you and your sister?
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
All right.
I'm only asking questions.
Me?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What?
You're damaged.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Not tonight.
I molested little girls.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
You really believe that?
What?
Why not tell me now?
You must hate your brothers.
I'm not scared.
Just think about it.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
Fine.  Be that way.
What about O-2?
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
I don't know, look around.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Tell me later.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
How many are there?
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
This one is gorgeous.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
That seems to apply to you also...
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
That's why I asked you...
I'm too sleepy.
I deserve it.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
And do you remember where she got off?
From Panarea. Why?
What boat?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
No.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I'm a blimp.
He loves you the way you are.
That's not what he meant.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Of God.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Have you ever loved anyone?
I love you.
Oh, there are so many.
And you like that?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Agnes, how are babies born?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Then let's talk about something else...
No.
Would you like some?
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Does it bother you?
No... do you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
I don't know.
You'll laugh.
Not my fault.
What the child?
And you're unhappy.
You can tell me.
I can't.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She...
... makes me...
Yes.
Her headaches.
Alright.
No I'm not.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Because I'm in trouble.
Because I was afraid.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
What do you feel?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Who?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
I put her to sleep.
Why?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Next week.
No!
Who are you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
None as far as I know.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
About two years before.
She has it now.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
How?
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Visitors to the convent.
What is it?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
You just said...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Become?  One is born a saint.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
No.
For the Church?
The father!
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Where is she?
Did you know she was pregnant?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
I left it with her and I went for help.
What happened to the baby?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
He'll be pulp by now.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
You do - repeatedly.
Of course I can.
Grotty?
Yeah, grotesque.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
No, straight up.
Ah well. Eh, look!
I'll look in here again.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
Is it ... is it, really?
The big hammer?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
And what do you do about it?
Pity.
Out where?
Books are good!
Lip reading.
Eh?
You see, sly villains.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Don't be callous.
Like what?
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
We were going to do it.
Is it?
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Gravity?
What's the terrain down there?
What's up?
Unknown.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
It grows on you.
That way.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
Right.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
No, I don't want us separated.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
Right. 
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Can you do anything for him?
At least it can't get up here now.
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
No.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
About four hours.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Not a one.  It's dead.
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
You win.
Can we get to him?
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Who gets the privilege?
Look...
What can I do?
Yeah...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Oh man...
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
You win some, you loose some.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
It's alright, it's cool...
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Which mean physically going outside.
Sounds great.
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
Compensate!
How many... how many people are missing?
Well... try the headset.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Agreed.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
What can I do?
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
It needn't be.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
Aren't you?
Stars.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
We're?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
Yes, Addison.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
Hear, hear...
Margo.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Eve! My understudy...
Just slipped your mind.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
This is Eve Harrington.
Huh?
Call me when you get in...
When - when are you coming back?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
She did...?
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
What's all over?
What a body, what a voice.
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
A married lady.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
How long does it take?
I don't care if I never get home.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
My husband...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Please...
I don't intend to be.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
I'm not crying.
I'll never get over it.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Over my dead body...
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
I won't be a minute.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
I wouldn't like.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Of course.
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
Roughly ten minutes.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Isn't that what they always say?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
I wonder why.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
I'm beginning to catch up.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Now just a minute-
I'm glad Bill's back.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
You'd have been proud of her.
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
I don't think I could be.
What's your being married got to do with it?
Call, what call?
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
Play it again.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
But what could she do?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Well...
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Yeah?
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
--a spy, you mean?
And you haven't called him?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
--you do?--with access to records?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
I never scared anyone before.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
And I'm a Republican.
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--has he got an ax?--
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
Goddamnit!--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
Night.
Oh.
--Howard Hunt?
Mind if I try?
I didn't.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--that was awhile ago--
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
I don't know titles.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I have nothing more to say.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Will you step forward, sir. 
No.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
I did all right on McCord.
Could develop.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
He just did.
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
-- Thanks, coach --
I'm not good in math.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Come on!  I won't tell.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Onions?
Sure.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
This isn't any better, Chris.
I know, it sucks!
Sure.
Of course.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Yeah, enormous.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Yes, slowly.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
How?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Yeah.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Thanks.
Doing what?
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
But you better hurry.
Yeah. Apparently.
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Serafine...?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Andy! No!
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Well, they are French.
Andy...
You on drugs? Huh?
No... I...
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
Andy? Andy is that you?
Claude.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Okay. So maybe you were right.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
When you're older . . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
I shant!
Poor Meetoo!
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
Now just get off the train.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Ew. . .  the honest type.
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
It worked in Odessa...
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
Watch me.
Rasputin!
Young	man, I...
Promise me she'll have her home.
She does.
Perhaps you could convince her?
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
What's your name?
Come on.
What?
This is Alvy Singer!
What do you mean, next?
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, no, I have a car.
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Nice car.
Yeah, my grammy.
Your grammy!
Well... thank you again.
Okay.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Oh, thank you.
I know.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Yeah.
Okay.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
H'm?
Oh, yeah?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
M'hm.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Ooooh!
I know you've only known me a short while.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Yeah.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Yeah.
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It was just great!
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Holy cow!
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
What... huh?
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Oh-
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
I thought just earplugs.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Dammit! I was so close.
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
You catch Dylan?
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Yeah, I love it there.
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
You're crazy!
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Well, sit down.
M'hm.
And... uh-
His wife has diabetes!
But she's colored.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Yeah.
Hey-
There's a whole wing in this house.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Very well.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Would it make a difference?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Absolutely.
She's a constant surprise.
To dander.  Otis.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Why would she care?
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Please?
Just did.  Jealous?
When does he graduate high school?
You really need to be fucked.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
I love you, Joe Therrian.
A perfect night.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Probably not.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I'm going to throw up.
I'll say as little as possible.
She left the fucking gate open.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Anyone else?
Don't.
I'll never forgive you.
I have no idea who you are.
It's a Calder.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
It's a novel.
No.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
What?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Sally!!!!
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
I like you.
Sorry?
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so sorry.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
I don't need a drug.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Thank you.
Oh?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh great.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
We're going to have to go back out there.
I guess.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
It's much more personal in here.
Oh honey, let's.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Hlllllllp!
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
You did?
Yes...he's wonderful...
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Yeah.  How much?
I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.
Ma'am?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Care to make a small wager?
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
I sort of like it.
Oh, I never catch colds.
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Oh.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Much better.
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
Someone from the office.
What's her first name?
Miss. 
I am. Let me get the cards.
I don't want it.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I just want some fresh air.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
I know so. He's a taker.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
You did?
Yes, nurse.
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You usually eat alone?
I don't?
Oh.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Mind if I come in?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
What kind of joint are you running?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
No I didn't.
Who else?
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Now will you get out?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Something like that.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
That so.
Who is Mickey?
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Good night?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Doctor.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
What do you think?
Are you sure that's what you want?
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
All set for what?
He wouldn't.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Don't you ever stop talking?
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
No -- absolutely not --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Sure, thanks.
No.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Yeah.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
Why they call you that?
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
No shit.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Where ?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
When'd you do it?
Which way? Right or left?
Whose orders ?
We ain't goin' down the river.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
Charlie?
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Sure -- fine --
Wh -- what?
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Who?
Yes, I know.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Yeah, I like it...
I can handle it.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
And shut up.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
What things?
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Well , who's in command here?
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
157  CONTINUED:
Your infrared camera?
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
-- Corbett's a killer.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
It's exactly what you meant.
-- Permanently?
Come here...
So what's the problem?
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
Hate to disappoint you.
Don't bet on it.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What does this matter to you?
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
We were just talking about him.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Me. My home number is on this card.
No.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
What's with the dark?
You all set here?
Yes.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Melvin, I'd rather not.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
No.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
What do you want?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
So am I, Frank.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Ask him.
What's he look like?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Thanks.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Picking on me won't help.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Uh, Fontella's
Yeah.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
How long have you been freelance?
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
What?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
I don't believe you.
It cost us.
Um, five.
I work for the government.
Yeah.
So this is something between you and him?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
And you want to use me to get him?
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Where you wanted to be?
How old were you?
Jesus -- why?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Yes.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
About?
Work.  The things I need to get done.
Yes.
Here?
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Yes.
What did he want?
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I didn't notice them.
What?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
Why?
Did he explain how this happened?
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
Because, I'll take it.
Am I attractive?
Why?  I don't know.
Was she the only one?
Why?
Wait until he is on the stairs.
What?
Electra --
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
I hope not.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
You mean quit?
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
Care to elaborate?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
They'll never get us.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
You capitalist pig!
I don't want to ruin your day.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Now you're using that word.
Yeah, somewhere?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Some deal you did there!
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
No!
Yes.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
You're everything a guy could want.
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
So, we won't be going to London?
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
But I love you!
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Sure, they are students.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Yo, dobree!
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
How do I know what's being said?
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
Well she sure isn't normal.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
We_re not all running away
Yeah seems okay.
Sometimes.
You will wish you hadn't.
Fuck you!
A kind of freedom.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Come on, that shit can wait.
We're not sure...
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
With you.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
No. I won't be long.
Were you with Jamie?
You sleeping with her?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I'm just wondering --
Later.
I don't want to have any conversation.
My act?!
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
No.
Your father doesn't like me.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Loved?
Twice a year.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
I'm sick.
I should have told you sooner --
Lower. Same page.
No.  Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself.  Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
That's right. You just act like one.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
You don't. That's the point.
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
A similar triangle?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
But he does! Don't you see?
No!
How are you?
Well... yeah...
I'm going to be at the dance.
Why what?
Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
Run out of gas?
March 11th.
Nineteen fifty --
Pro! Release the rope!
Oh, right, right... 
Then where the hell is he?
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Why?
Is Shemp all right?
Ssshhhhh!
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
What? 
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
What did you do to your hair?
Oh yeah?
No, he showed me one.
I used to throw trash for the City.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Nope.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Sure thing. Come on.
Tom...
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Spanish.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
How's he doing?
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Excuse me.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Positive?
Yes.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Yes?
No.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Any time.
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Please, Barton.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Drown all those rascals...
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Just Bill, please.
Then who should I talk to?
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
I didn't say anything-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Well what do I tell him?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
And I could tell you some stories –
See you, Charlie.
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back – with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
Yeah...
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
...Yeah, okay.
So they say.
Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
Hold on –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Lou.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
But, you know, with the head still on.
Mr. Lipnik, please –
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
What else is new?
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
I had him in two classes.
You can make a mistake.
Fine.
Please.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Yes.
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Did you miss me?
What are you researching?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why?
How's that?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
He had a girlfriend?
I never heard of him.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Is he dead?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
I don't like beer.
We can do better. It needed more white.
Aren't they?
You name it, I paint there.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
I didn't see you.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Should there be?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Still not here.
About what?
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Come on, let's get out of here.
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
You want some?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Don't you think he's using you?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
Yeah.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
You're not the Mayor.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Sure.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
Dad!  Save yourself!
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
What seems to be the problem?
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Coming on line now, sir.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Hey, what's your problem?
What are you talking about?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Damn?  Damn is not good.
I didn't kill your wife.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
What are you talking about?
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
People come first, Dr. Isley.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Adam and Evil.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Just checking, young sir.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
You are direct, aren't you?
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Nostrovia.
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
Well, I met someone...
What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
I don't want to remember!
You do know. Try.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What?
What are you talking about?
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
...You gonna kill me?
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
I'll take you with me.
I loathe bats.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
... Terror.
No one would miss me.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
I feel naked without it.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
WHAT?
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it?
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
What?  I improved her a little...
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Tom Jones?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Right first time.
oh dear.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
She's ... well, she's good.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
What makes you say that?
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Well, there is that ...
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
off the peg?
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Yeah, we should party.
Me first!
Heh heh. Thank God.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
You mean there's mre than one?
This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-dumpling...
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Ah, the witness?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
That's my girl!
They make gypsies look good.
<u>You</u> left me.
That's all we need.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Then it should be here.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
What makes you think she likes me?
Is this like a trick question?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Can you scare them off?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
No.  What's wrong?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
Step... mother.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Their wedding clothes.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Yes, Robert. I will.
He does, does he?
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Yes, I suppose that's true.
I have no idea...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Oh, yes.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I like it here.
I am a very good gardener.
That's good.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Our greenhouse.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I have nothing more to say.
I see.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I understand.
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Oh, I see.
A flower...
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Yes.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
I see.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
I see...
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... Oh, really...
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Do you need a secretary?
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
... Would you take me on a tour?
I said good night!
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
No, sir.
That could be possible...
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Malkovich!
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Hmmm.
I was worried.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
Suck my dick!
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Money, Miss Warts?
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
No. I understand perfectly.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
Can I be anyone I want?
Vegas? What'd you think?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fork ah did?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Why not? I need to get in there!
One hour.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
What's the play?
Who needs dancing?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Was a time I knew what was.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Well, good luck with the job.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Be here. In case.
Won't you be late for work?
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Oh I been out.
I know what I see.
Might see anything at all at 124.
The church!
He ask, I give him anything.
It's her, ain't it?
That's so.
For what?
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Never found out.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I don't believe that. I won't.
You don't know what I think.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
All he can. All he can.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Uh?
Well Dude, we just don't know.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Uh-huh.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
Come and get it.
Yeah, but we're--
I'm going home, Donny.
That fucking bitch!
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Uh-huh.
In the briefcase?
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
That's really thoughtful but I--
And please don't call her my mother.
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Finder's fee?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Huh...
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What?
Theodore Herzel.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Calmer than you are.
Just for making the hand-off?
What if it's during a game?
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Huh?
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Huh?
No.
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
Is the car out front yours?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Shit yeah!
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
Yeah, and you were--
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
No Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
You're a fuck, Walter!
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Huh?
Fuckin' A.
Well. . . yeah.
Help me put him back in his chair.
This is a league game, Smokey!
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
I didn't know.
Time.
Fry 'em.
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
I don't think so.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Took you long enough.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Blood...
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Going on twenty years now.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
You should've killed her, then.
Don't even start, old man.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
You're joking --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
There is no cure.
The way they move, they way they smell --
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Cancer.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I was in the neighborhood.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I don't believe that.
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
He is an abomination!
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
<u>Yes</u>.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
--scared the living shit out of us.
--you should get back into bed.
I guess, yeah.
What?
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
What'd you dream?
I can't.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--hours before--
Yeah.
I can't.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
Something. Someone.
Fine.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Four in the morning?
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
What?
Too busy eating us?
Still don't see it--
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
I'm not finished.
Asleep--
Enough to keep sane.
I think it's time to get out of here.
Ah, Domini?
--and we brought it back with us!
And what's your excuse for being here?
Okay.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
--a <u>lot</u>.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--yes--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
It won't?
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
What?
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
What'd he say?
Ever durned one.
What night is it?
Well now you do.
Well what?
What do you think?
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
What?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Yes sir.
Not yet.
Those are my breasts.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Frank? .can you stand up?
That's good.
I'm doing it.
You. what?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
I want you to stay with me.
Who, Dorothy?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Go where?
Nothing.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I don't know. he moved away.
Yeah. Good bye.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Let's go.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah.
Brilliant.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
He got a little jealous.
Yeah?
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey?. Why?
You like mysteries that much?
Okay. great!
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
uh uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Well. Okay.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Yeah, I know.
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
I'll get a coat for her.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
... Stop it Mike.
Motherfucker works fast.
He what?
Five-thousand per kilo.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
You happy, baby?
Yeah.  I am.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
It's garbage.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
No?
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
Murder.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
I know.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
No more brothers, Diego.
Coke.
Actually, it was three.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
I'll tell her.
That was a beautiful message.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
I said, I've seen it before.
Alright.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You swear?
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
That's right.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Yes, a name for the operation.
Let's hope forever.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
You got something on the coke?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Counsel approach the bench.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Back off, John.
Rebecca Lawson.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
What about Miss Lawson?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Yes.
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
No.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
We dated for about a month last year.
Then what happened?
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
I suppose.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
Because he called me.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
No further questions.
You still haven't answered my question.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
No pain, no gain?
Something like that.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Hi, Frank.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
Really?
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
What?
Tonight we open new doors.
You're a monster.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
This is not relaxing.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
I'm not.
Talk to me.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
What time did you leave?
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Doesn't matter. Move on.
No treasure maps, huh?
No.
Come here a minute.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
I never knew that.
Nobody did.
No, what?
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
And how long are you here for?
Oh. How old?
Why did you stop?
You get used to it.
When?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Yes.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
Do you want to leave your husband?
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
No.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
What were your parents like?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
Then he can move! People move!
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
But now that you have it -
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I'm going to miss you.
It's only four days.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
WHAT!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
What the hell you talking about?
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Just try it.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
Have you ever been inside?
I lied.
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Mother!  No.
You moved into this block?
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Patrick, he's...
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Back here.  At the end of the block.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Dad?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
Ours!
What we have to do is call the police.
All right!  Where's the key?
All part of the business.
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
They just left, didn't they?
It's impossible!
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
The hell I can't!
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
What?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Everything you couldn't.
They were in a car accident.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Good idea.
What?  They ain't there?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
All right.
Oh, really.
Thanks.
No.
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
You have to ask?
No.
Almost five years.
I'm already in your bed.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
What was it then?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
Good.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Sweet Jesus.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
What do you want to do?
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
Why?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
So now you know.
That's all I get?
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Sir, you waited on line.
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Thanks.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
Get the fuck away from my car.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Then I'll find another ride.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?

That's it?  Is that it?
I guess so.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
-- we'll explain it --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

I can't protect you anymore.
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
Yes.
Wait a minute --
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
That's the only angle.
What's that?
Abbott wants to talk.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
Where am I?
Got there!
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
...Yer nostril?
...sabotage!
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Layton.
Well, I ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
What has Tuttle done?
Very smart.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Why?
So what are you going to do about her?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Is it stamped?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Oh, sorry.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
It's my fucking life.
I didn't like it.
Where are you taking me?
Suit me?
You're joking.
Stop it ... damn you!
We? Don't blame me!
"And your children all gone."
Leave me alone!
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Yes.
Are you sure?
Don't worry.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
What! Shit!
Actually, I've decided ...
Not now ... please
Er, yes ...
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
This is an emergency!
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Ha!!
What do they want you or?
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
He flipped out.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I should be going. I just quit.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
I think it looks good.
He's better.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
No, no.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Crazy fucker.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Who with?
He's crazy. He can't help it.
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
What?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Don't push it, Larry.
Faster!
Used to be my partner.
You sure?
One more time!
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Why?  What did they do to you?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.
I don't think so.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Which would you prefer?
A half hour in the lobby.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
As good as humanly possible.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
This isn't friendship.
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
Your hair's a little funny.
Outside?
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Wipe me out?
Move away from me.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Yes.
Great.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
I knew what you meant.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
You're saying stay away from him.
Through the closet.
What, right now?
Are you nervous, Walter?
Are you a virgin?
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Bye!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
There's...a body inside that statue!
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
What are you doing here so early?
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I know.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Huh?
I didn't buy it I made it.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Well, w-what did you do?
Never mind...
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
Why not?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Then let me give you something then...
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Cheer up.  You may still.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
What's with you?
Suck!
Bummer metaphor.
Would you sleep with them?
You look like shit, Benny.
Get away from here.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Down there.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Eeyuu.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Maybe.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Something like that.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Buffy.
Is that your car?
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Come again?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Cafe Blase.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
It's true.
Uh... gym.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Okay.
Oh, fuck you!
Five.
Not if you're careful.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
I can't work this.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
I was just scared is all.
Cassandra's really smart.
Thanks.
You're having a fling with him?
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
Good.
Well, I hope so.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
You want some punch?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
Catch?
My right nostril?
What a nasty thing to say.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
Don't worry.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
But you were pulling your hips last night.
So...Wanta make love?
That's my job too.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I doubt that.
Why not?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
Never heard of 'em.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
I won't have to.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Jesus.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
C ' mon!
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
No.
No.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Crash, shut the door.
...and one helluva guy.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Hey!
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
Hello.
Right back.
That's right.
Okay.
I can't! I'm tied!
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
In so many words, yes.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
I don't wanna come along with you.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
My wife?
Yeah.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
And at the...
...hundred yards further down the road.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
She was afraid to call you.
I'll be right there.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Good to meet you.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
It's chinchilla.
Oh...
Oh, fabulous.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
You can't make me stop caring...
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
What'd you have?
She had the same.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
I should have -
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You understand? What? Let you go?
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Yeah, okay.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
You're firin' me?
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Sam?
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Okay.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now move along.
Here we go!
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
It's instinctive, you know.
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
How are you?
Fine, fine.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
He's good. He's fine.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Yeah.
Okay, Sammy.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
You're so nice. 
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
Yeah?
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
All right, all right.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Yes.
Get lost?
Come on! 
Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
Right.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
All right.
Two?
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Get up.
This peter's a motherfucker.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
She asleep?
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
So are we.
What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No more! You see? Watch!
Hey.
Yeah.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Having a good time?
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
It's okay. Let her go.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
We'll hunt him down together...
What little boy doesn't?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Did you just say "girls?"
What's the good news?
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
What did--?
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
You going to talk all day?
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
I didn't hurt you.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Then whose is it?
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Who smashed the phone?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Oh won't I?
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Shit!
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Tell me what she looks like.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Our house always needs touching up.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I've got to ask somebody.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Not a chance.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
What's going on?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
You can't give up.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Damned if I know.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
What's Nels' number?
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Sure.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
We don't see you.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I don't know what you mean.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Five minutes.
We're gonna get there first.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Let her tell you.
Undercover.
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
He's what she should run a mile from.
I'm sorry.
Saw it, Dil.
Did I?
Cunt.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Not in my experience.
Who?
Not English.
Scottish?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
Half-five. At Millie's.
I wonder.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Must be.
Jesus.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Are you jealous of him?
That's good...
Depends what it is.
No, depends on nothing.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Sorry, darling.
Are you pretending yet?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
You like me better like this.
Only in times of extreme stress.
Jimmy?
Try and go, then.
I like you, DIl
Whatever you say, Dil.
Tell me what she wore.
Not if you go.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Aha.
Did you give him it?
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
No, what is the thing?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Of course. I forgot.
You know what. Go.
Who's the old geezer?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Thanks.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
I understand.
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
No fucking way.
Only joking.
You want to bet?
She's not my type.
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
Don't I know it.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
My special friend.
We don't look on it like that.
I didn't.
I don't know her.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Stop that talk now --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
And you know what?
People. They could be looking.
It was fun while it lasted.
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
What are you talking about?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
What?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Lord, you're stubborn.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
The letter --
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Of course there is!
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Then say it.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Only we call them agents.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Agent.
So that was it.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
But no one actually saw him die.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Next, please.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
But you're -- divorced?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'll wreck your raincoat.
It's all right with us --
Scobie?
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
There must be some way.
There, you said it.
Said what?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
You did.
No.
Or Tex?
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
I'm scared.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Meaning what?
Tell me what?
Where did he keep his money?
Okay.
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Up there! I would put it up there!
No, Jean-Louis.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is your husband with you?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
The man and the woman are married --
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Who said?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
I don't understa--
Don't you want me to stay?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
Good.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
That's impossible.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
Who is she Daddy?
She just turned off her light.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
Who's?
Ok.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Sure.
I really do. For your own safety.
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What party?
Especially not your dad.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Follow me.
What?
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Yeah.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
Pretend we're just another couple.
You can ask me anything.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
That's what he said.
The library. I'll be fine.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The word is Mob.
Who were they?
You're not telling me something.
Are you Jody?
Kenny's aunt?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
So are you.
That wasn't me ...
Unfair?!
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Huh?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

...and a shitload of ice.
And if that Elvis shit...
All right, then how about this?
I need your truck!
That dog was mean before I met him.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Oh, man.
...-er.
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.
Okay, okay! 
Okay. 
Take your gun!
What?
Kiss my ass!
...-cho and a hijack-...
...I believe in live and...
Back up!  Back...
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Oh, shit.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
...easy, easy, easy.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Come on, old...
What the fuck was that?!
 Go, go.
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 

I'm a dangerous man!
...man!
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.

...-tion?
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
We were nationally  ranked.
...hospital.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
We got two paddles.
I mean, if that gun was...
I think you oughta cut a...
Okay. 
...on!
What the--?
You've gotta be...


 

We got-...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.


Always the negative...
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
...within five minutes.
But...
...such is the price...of patriotism.


Exactly.
However, you are also non-en-...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
I'd say we're about even.
Is it--?
Any of them Richard Long?
...-tor Long.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...that.
Grateful?
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
"Went away."  I like that.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Brynner.
Good to see you again, Leo.
I'll do it.
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
I think I gave it to her.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No. She's probably scared to death.
When was the last time?
What about her?
Just find the girl.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Just bring your checkbook.
Ain't worth thinking about.
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
I'll just tell my wife.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
Why?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Didn't you call?
I don't.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
Yes.
Iced tea.
What?
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
Well, how much would you like?
Did he know?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
I mean I can't tell you.
No. I'm just a snoop.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
The Valley?
No.
They may not know it but they are.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
They do in Chinatown.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
...A flaw...
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
What about?
You mean she just found out?
You're insane.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
...where does Kyo live?
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
You'll find one of those people.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Help yourself.
Only when I breathe.
Yes...
Si.
Sure you do.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
...Yes of course.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Since lunch.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Neither do I.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
That's right, Modern Times.
What's she like? What's she like?...
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
Hi. Why are you running?
Who?
No...
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Where is he?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
Who said anything about brooms?
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Yes, Mr. Kane.
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Toothache.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Susan, I really think -
Can't say, sir.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Look out that window.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
I had a toothache.
Rosebud?
Unnhh!
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
I think you'd better leave now.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
You're kidding.
He was?
Dante. You've got a customer.
How do you know that?
No, you're not really getting married?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Was I right?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
He's your fiancé.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
You're such an asshole.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Oh God...
Yeah.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Peptic ulcer.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
What smells like shoe polish?
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
She called you Brad?
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Yeah.
I think they were Catholics.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
I guess not.
The milkmaids?
Which ones?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Veronica!
Can you believe this?!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
What?
Don't yell at me, pal.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Gatorade.
It's today.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.
An embarrassing way to die.
Who found him?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
Not yet. 
I like to expand my horizons.
You're bullshitting.
I'm happy.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
There's no lights back there.
What time did we go to the funeral?
This life.
Why do I have this life?
I was born.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
Leave me alone.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
It's hard to swallow.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
THE GLADES MOTEL?
I don't know.
I... I don't believe this...
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Hunhh? Nothing.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
And I actually date you?
Twelve.
You're a pig.
Why'd you hit me?
Three?
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
What do you mean?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
What is it?
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
Thank you for the lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Would you let me explain...
I don't want to go back with her...
Can I have your name please?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
No way!
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Says who?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
I admit, I can be bought.
I copy.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Fine, I guess...
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
And I can't leave.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Yeah, let's go.
Excuse me?
You know me, I'm a night person.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Breathtaking.
Never, what?!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
Tucker and Walker.
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
You're looking at him.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Appreciate it.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Who are they, sir?
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
It's alright, thank you.
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Crime?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Big, big money.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Travel...and things.
Just had one.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
How often you go?
Where are you, what floor?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
I think...
Twenty five?
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
He paid for 'em.
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
It's not that kind of job.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
You always stutter?
No.  You say you're cool.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
You said you were visiting friends!
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
No.
It's what I do for a living.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Let her go.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
As opposed to?
I noticed.
Believe you about what?
That was him.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Where are we going, Jerry?
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
Did you kill my father?!
Love at first sight?
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
You knew just what I was there for.
You think it's a conspiracy?
I'm not sure what you mean.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
You don't understand --
And Jonas?
Ellie?
What?
Yes, sir.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Ellie...
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
Right.  Well.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
It's beautiful.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
You want to classify prime numbers?
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
And?
Ellie --
You sonofabitch.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Spoken like a true believer.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
I don't think so.
It's getting late...
What are you so afraid of?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
They don't believe me.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Git your shovel and git to work.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
You don't know!
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Get away!
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Like I always do?
Forty-five.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
You phony creep!
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
When he was seventeen.
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
In jail.
<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
You do that one, I don't want it...
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Michael Johnson.
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Tell it to your shrink.
What about her arms?
Right.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Or the F.B.I.?
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
One of your suitors?
I'd like to go back. James...
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
So - why the airport?
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
Hard to say.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
There's nothing to tell.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Do you think I should?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Oh, no, of course not.
I ruined your wedding night.
But what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
You've only known Jake a few months.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
A deal's a deal.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
Anything interesting.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I do.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
So there were no problems?
I'll see you tonight.
You've got one hell of a great body.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Coming.
Bingo.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
I'm calling in sick.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
No, no.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Who?
Oui.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
And?
He missed three weeks.
Yes.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Half the tapes.
Where are you from?
Cops?
I can't believe you didn't check.
I think he's already figured that out.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Has to be.
Can I trust you, Sami?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Just find them!
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
I'm not going to leave you.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Mr. Taylor?
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
How?
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I don't know.
Something like that.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
You don't seem to understand.
He is my defeated foe!
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
How so?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
No, really?
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give it back.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
I left the training early.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
A murderer?
Father!
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
This is a delicate matter.
Annie, I need a file.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Mister Funboy lives there?
You gotta go now, I bet.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
In a better place.  I hope.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Fine with me.
Very well, it's your ass.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Kill a dead guy?
Did you know Sebastian well?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
A friend wrote me.
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
How about tonight?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
No?
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
- none taken -
The football stud?
What do you mean?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Eyes closed.
Okay.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
Some other time, Cecile.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Care to make a wager on that?
But who will they turn to for help?
I hate it too.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
What's your problem?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
With who?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
And I don't.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Come again?
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's the least I can do.
Well please leave a message that I called.
She's out.
Annette! Annette!
Did she show up?
What are you talking about?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Yes, darling.
Did your wishes ever come true?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
What do you mean?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Why didn't you run after them?
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
It's true.
It was just a voice.
Yes, Amy?
I've wanted a friend.
But you must!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
But she's dead!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
But why?
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
That means I can go alone?
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
And Amy mailed them?
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
I've changed a lot lately.
Anything's better than Mark.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
At least your PMS is over.
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
It is so hot in here.
I still thought it was a purse.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
Okay, I gotta go.
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
No.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
I wish I only had your problems.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
Well, whattdaya think?
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Yeah right... You better go.
So pay them back and apologize.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
On your desk.
Did you change your hair?
No?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
No, she died when I was twelve.
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Goodnight.
I love you too.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
They do? Oh no...
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
Packages of money.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Like a vampire or some shit?
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
What makes her think that?
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
How could you have been so stupid?
Yes, sir.
Patricia Crenshaw.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Put it through...
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Who?
Don't know much, do you?
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
You seem restless.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Maybe.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
How do you know I'm innocent?
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
... Alright.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
) Listen, you little...
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
And...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Are you out of your mind?
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Are you threatening me?
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Oh, yeah... probably...
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
We vetoed that?
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
You're not?
Of course.
What about it?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
You1re leaving, too?
I don't mind.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
But you could go to jail for it.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I know. I'm sorry...
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
I know.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
All set.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Then why did you come here?
The tunnel.
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
No wonder they're so....hungry.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
In the battle, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
Yep.
Oh come on, Pitts...
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
what?!
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
I'm in.
What good will that do?
Huh?
Knox, you're crazy.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Uh-huh.
My Word
Meeks.
LOUDER!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Yes sir.
Come on, that's impossible.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
From my father and Nolan.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh. 
He's the owner...
Why don't you want a message sent?
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
Who asked any?
You're going to have to get a new one.
He's with them.
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Thank you, I work at it...
On the side!!
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
We can't just leave them here.
What?
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
This time, make an exception.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Nowhere...
Plans don't change...
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
Fuckin' A!
You're full of shit.
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
Jesus, it's freezing!
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Married?
You mean...?
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
No.
Oh, well...
Psst. Vince!
Inside, Vince.
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Will you marry me?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
C'mon. I've got the car.
This is horrible!
Merle, I wanna go home!
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Pow?
What are you, God?
We what?
Three bullets -- minimum.
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
Listen, Nick --
No.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
What's it for??
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Technothugs?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Remember my promise.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Aces.
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
And you should be with your family.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
You never want to find out.
Seat's too high.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
He lied to me again.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
What Grange?
-- in gold.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Afraid ... of what?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
About what?
You know darn well it is.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Who is it?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Well ... make him keep quiet.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
Wouldn't profit him none.
Coming, Ma.
What's that?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
I'll be there, too!
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
I object.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
The past six months.
That is Christmas music.
I'll find someplace.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Go fuck yourself.
I'm a cop from New York.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
So I've heard.
They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Thanks...partner.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Roy?
Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Listen.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
What about the kids?
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I'm really shakey.
You're really crazy.
Where you gonna go?
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
I don't have a choice.
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
What kind of things, Leon?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
We like you, too.
I don't think so.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
No, that's all.
You stopped?  Why?
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Pure?
Let's go, Sonny.
Get 'em in the vault!
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
Alive.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
What can he do, he's clean...
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.

That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
I own a brownstone on this block.
Have you noticed something about them?
And?
Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
Two dollars!  Forget it!

A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
I'm fine.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Just down the hall.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
The principal.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
Oh, of course.
Just a guy I hang out with.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Am not.
Well, I'm listening now.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
Do you know what this means?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
I know.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Can you believe it?
That's the downside. There is none.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Thanks, Pop.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Yes!
And, take some more pictures.
What?
Everything?
Everything. Just for the record.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Love it!
With your permission...
Yes?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
Excellent!
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
Yes...
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
It is my home.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
Huh?
Ha!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Soon, Bela... Soon.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Perfect.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I don't know.  Where?
Rolling.
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
These shoes are itchy.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
It takes me comfortable.
But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
But you used to say --
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Hruphh...?
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like to think so.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
We're escaping!
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Isn't he dead?
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Why not??
Maybe it needs special handling.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Huh?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Lines around the block.
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
No.
Al!!
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Good luck.
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Right, right...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Holy sh--
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
She could've been a nurse.
What's the difference?
The doctor said you were having sex.
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
So?
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
Really?
Oh yeah.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Twenty-nine.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Show business.
What?
Why do you do that?
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
No. What happened?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the girl!
Please!
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Check forging.
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
Tu
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
But you haven't written your novel.
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Here, get down.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
You're kidding, right?
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Ethics are...
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Sure
Good luck, Tracy.
What is it. Tammy?
I have proof.
Dave.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Three twenty-five.
Three twenty-five.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Yeah.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
I'm not like you.
I know.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
How'd she meet Patchett?
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
So tell me about it.
Call me Dudley.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
How what, Wendell?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
Of course...
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Just show me where they are!
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Gone.  Not a trace.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
White's a mindless thug.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Yes, I do, sir.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
What's this all about, lad?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
No.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
Decorated?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What are you talking about?
A vulgar term, but yes.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
No.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Right now, before I back down.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
And Reynolds?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Something like that.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Oh Jesus.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Told by whom?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
Wait. What do I do?
What if--
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
They're here.
Fuckin-A.
What about newspapers and magazines?
So what do we do now?
Listen--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
It's a little late for that.
That's my point.
Why?
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
A report?
A police report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Than why can't you tell me.
Not that I could see.
No.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
It's okay.
He's got his priorities?
Yeah...look--
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Oh, please--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I know.
Just reporters.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Here, you can use this.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Do you like fish?
Not that much.
He doesn't work that way.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
Rachel--
I'm gonna fix it.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
Who would do that?
She doesn't want to talk to you.
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
No, I--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
So do I!
Bobby--
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
What?
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
He's clever. He had help.
We believe?
No sir.
We don't know.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Excuse me?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.
What do you mean, poetry?
Pardon?
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Now.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Would you let me pass?
Don't talk.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
There you have me.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Her hands and feet were tied.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
When's Clifton picking you up?
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Rabbit hunting.
I liberated it.
I can get in the back.
Are you planning to be the exception?
What did you say?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.
My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure…
I can already see.
I can see my wife in that view.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Really?  That's sudden.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Never heard of it.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
Hana, I know you do!
I've met you before.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
Of course.  When?
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
I don't think so.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
What's he saying?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
What are you talking about?
No.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Exactly.
You got a better idea?
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Don't overestimate yourself.
I'm in the middle.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
How about if you try disappearing.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
I never carry...baggage.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
We go underwater?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
Let's just see how we do.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
I've got something for you.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Something like that.
In eye of that painting.
Ready.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
I'd taken the Mask?
Where the money is.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Surgically attached.
Call it a new tradition.
But that's all behind us now.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
I'm not leaving without you.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You mean the seven billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
It's never big enough.
It better be worth it for me.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
It's too soon.
You damn well thought wrong.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
How does someone get meningitis?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
If you hadn't used profanity --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
And if you had to guess ...
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Why not?
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
Good.
I think we should makes some changes.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Ross.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
In the conference --
We'll see.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
You got a little girl?
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
I'm gonna clean it up.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
I didn't say that.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Yeah.  Who are you?
Next week.
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
We're not out of this yet.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
How do I look?
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Try and control this ...
Never heard of that system.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
Repairs ...
What have you done to my ship?
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
We have no use for your kind.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
I didn't say anything?
Are the coordinates set?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
You are reckless!
But I feel The Force flowing!
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
What's in there?
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Believe what?
I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
Humans?
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
It's so good to see you again.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Defense against what?
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
A medical team will be standing by.
Yeah, I got it.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Later.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Who?
Who ain't?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
...Perceval!
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
But your life and lands are far from here.
It is deep...
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
Rise, Mordred.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
Because you and the land are one.
I will run.
A lovestruck page!
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
I swear it.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It's-
Why don't you let me?
Burke.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Convulsion?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
I'm Father Karras.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Um........Stuff.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
The closet
Yeah.
You know how?
How do you know?
Honey this is Father Dyer.
That's good.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Good bye.
Withering Heights.
I've seen it.
In here. With us.
Intensely.
You and us.
Bon Jour.
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
No momma.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Really?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Is that a threat?
Who's in it?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Why not?
Give me the keys!
Mondays.
Your pay.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
We have some lotion.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
Teeth.
Accident?
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Recognize these two characters?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Like an angel.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Try the black Knable.
No.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
Talk.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
She'll get here.
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Last?
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Because I can hear it.
What?
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
Huh?
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
Cancel, Frank.
Better give her pneumonia.
I don't know. Some disease.
What?
Shut up, Frank.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Who's weak now, big brother?
So what'd you think?
Just call me a cab.
The flu.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
What about me?
My watch is broken, too.
You're an hour and a half late.
Miss --
I sing now?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
What's wrong with it?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine.
Zip me up?
Did you hear it?
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Smells like fish.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Wow. You ever see her again?
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Forget it.
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Uh ... thanks.
I'll call you.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Gotta go.
How come?
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Regular hours are eight to five.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
He'll come around.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
The Stratford.
Like a baby. You?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Better than that.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
Friend.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Yeah... No.
I've given it up.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Merry Christmas.
He's losing his teeth.
I'm not the same person you remember.
Why would he need more?
Like ...
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
For being one helluva guy.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
It's important.
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
You said it, Jon, not me.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
The Admiral?
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Gone?
... That's great.
Call me spontaneous.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
So you left her?  Just like that?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
What’s going on here?
I don’t know...
Bye...
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Right.  That’s a major oversight...  So if I’m Kate...I can’t really afford the finer things, my husband’s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I’m trapped in suburbia...
Great room...
I don’t think so.
It’s just two kids, right?
You’re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Get out, I call 911.
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Whatever you say...honey.
Do what?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
What? You make me hot...
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Are you okay, Jack?
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
Okay, I’ll take them...
No...I’m not...
Last night was great...
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
You'd never know it.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Solid.
Yeah, nine years straight.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Baby, you're scaring me.
Ben!  Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
You've been working out.
Oh, it is.
They're not costumes.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
I gave him twenty.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Here's the overall Target Area...
How bad off is he?
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Here's the Surgeon.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
You mean <I'm> going along?
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
We're pushing oxygen today.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
You left something out.
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
Then don't drift down further.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
Unghh... oh, geez...
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Certainly.
I don't think so. It's nice.
I don't know. Few munce.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Huh?
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
What the heck d'ya mean?
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Officer Olson.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
Yah.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Huh? Yah?
...Brainerd?
Yah, I see.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, so we're all set.
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Okay.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
...Yah.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
...Is everything okay?
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
No kiddin'?
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Well, they -
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
Mm.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah...
Yah?
Aw, Norm.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
No.
Yah.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And his wife?
Oh, my.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Look at my face.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
Yes?
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Practicing what?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Should we?
You haven't been going to yours.
Look, this is a bad time...
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
I could check your prostate.
Is that what you're calling it?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What did you say... ?
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Who's this?
You fucking slut!!
... You know me?
My suitcase was vibrating?
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
No, supply oxygen?
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
My dad.  No question.
Same here.
Alive or dead?
Hemingway.  You?
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
You took me to the house.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
Stop finishing...
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
... no, no, no...
You will.  You know you will.
Appreciate something.
What?
My eyes are open.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Abort the plan.
Well, sir, you said you might.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
You're welcome to join our club.
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.
Please, God, no...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
I...I...
Should we knock?
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Random, sure.
Carter.
Blow me.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
No.  What's this about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
...My Premonition was just like his.
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
I...I don't know.
Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Who am I, David Blane?
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
As in flannels and plaids?
Thirty-nine.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
In Death...
Design?
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
No.
Batteries not included.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
There are no worse places.
Damn!  Leeches.
You comin'?
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Typical...
Can you walk?
Yeah.  Big time.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Most men are.
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
No... thanks... Listen --
<u>What</u>?!
Sshhhh!
A quest?
The Little...
Him...?
But I can't get it... He's...
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
So what? You going to help me?
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
It sounds exciting.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
I never say anything I have to.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I'm going on over there...
Now, hand...
Who said I was depressed?
Just finish eating.
No, let's go...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Five'll do it.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
He's had two strokes.
Don't tell me about this...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Wait...
All right...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Sort of.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Why are you being so mean?
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Swimming?
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Tomorrow, then.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
I don't think that's accurate...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Thanks, Carl...
What?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
All right, let's have a rematch.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
There's some good things on it, though.
Pardon me?
Yes.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Aaron, how you doin'?
So get the fuck outta here.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Hi.
Nothin'.
No.  What you do today?
Of course.
So what's her name?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
You know, Eddie's cousin.
She didn't say she had no man.
Jus' from around the way.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
That's what he said.
Wonder who his supplier is.
Not luck. They don't want me.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Full name.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
Yes.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Oh, he was dying for years.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
I'm fine.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Cut the crap and read it.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Velma.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Fletch?
What's that?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Alan Stanwyk.
Come inside.
So why pick me?
I have the same problem with my help.
You sure got the hard part.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Sure.
Deal.
'Magic' today, huh?
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
I love the outfits.
I bet you do.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
I ordered lunch.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
What is this?
Long story.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Gail, please.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
They're trying to kill me!
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Who are you?
So you're saying she moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I want something I can print!
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Forget it.
Not really.
Not really?
Who's Frieda?
Of course.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
I'll do my best.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
You're not funny.
Wha --
Why are all these people after me?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Yeah, go on...
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Really?
Anyway you want it, asshole.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I'm clean.
You don't use shit?
Everything is everything.
What?
Where do you want it?
This side.
Well try, okay?
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
What?
Marseilles.
You want some eggs.
Strike out, eh?
When ya go back on?
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
Who's on him?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Never trust a nigger.
Drink this.
Come on -- just for fun --
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Third time around.
Why is it called Hellgate?
For garbage?
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Baltimore?
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Don't know what's behind it.
One way to find out.
He ain't the only one.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
The future guy?
I think you know, Frank.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Uh, huh.
Frank, please...
Next time lets put some money on it.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Nah, I gave it up.
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
October 12, 1969.
Yeah, it's me.
Tell me.
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
It's Mom.
Whatta we do now?
I'm right here, Dad.
What?
In my pocket.
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
What...
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Nothing you're willing to do.
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Which means he probably knew her.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Sounds good.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
I look familiar?
No.  What house you work?
Fuck you, asshole.
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Yes, man!
This is all the exercise I need...
Nothing.
Are you all right, Shelly?
What do you mean?
And, what about us?
Not us!  He's really creepy.
You're the boss.
It was nothing.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
You're wrong.
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Why?
I wish it was.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
'Cause it stinks.
Lake Forest Green?
You gotta be kidding!
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
You food'll be right out.
That's it, we're done.
Okay, I'll call you later.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Good night, beautiful.
'Night, Josh.
That's what I'd like to know.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Okay.
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
But she might be in trouble...
What are you going to do?
But...wait a minute!
Nothing.
Hear what?
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I don't think that's such a safe idea
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
What about you?
Please, hurry...
Shut up, Elliot.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
It's just a review.
Do we care?
Do not inhale.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Let's work on it.
She's dying.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
A flat-out hit.
It's your best play, Nicky.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
I'm at the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Since when did that matter?
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
Oh yeah?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
I want to believe.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
How come?
Mine was cobalt blue.
I think I remember.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
He's a very sweet man.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
Never mind.
Eleven.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I thought you were a man of God.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
A -- a week.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
It's for the best.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
It would be five thousand more.
No?  What's keeping you?
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
What a pity.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Where did you get this?
Often.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
You had to be a right-hander.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
They found my eyelash.
I'm sure I could have.
How the hell did you get here.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
That's the hair color in his profile?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Yes.
You'll be next.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
I get my own help.
Beynon.
No applause!
No way. I've got to get out now.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Sure...
Good.
Whisky and a peach.
After four years and now the question comes up.
You got the parole, didn't you?
I didn't. I just waited.
That bad?
Why?
He might be ready to chop us up.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
Do it my way.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
He must have.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Like what?
I didn't mean police.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
El Paso.
No scars.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
You want to try with me?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Two.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Dillinger got killed.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Suit yourself.
Why not?
You serious?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
That right?
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I'll tell you when.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did you do?  Albert?
This is my brother's car.
Yes.
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
Of course. Where else?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
And what was that?
Brumby.
Yeah.
Expect so.
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
Las Vegas.
How'd you find me?
Get knotted.
Oh yes? How?
My brother, Frank.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
No, you won't.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
That little shit!
What you going to do?
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
Can't say I do.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Still got your sense of humour.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Ha.
...they hold on to their money...
I...I don't know.
They did.
All of, they got you on this "board..."
Eh...?
...that's right...
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...cower in his boots...
No.
He's doing very well.
The nurses?
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Men come work for you...
When they...
What?
What?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Talking about it as a...
Have I said that?
Did you talk to Graff?
He'd give me a job.
You...
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I do?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
What?  You can't do any what?
I am?
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
...what am I going to do all month...
To the cops?
Why don't you think so?
Could I...
Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? 
Roma.
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Murray...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
...ah, fuck this...
I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
Alright.
Excuse me...
What are you talking about?
You robbed the office.
I don't know what you are saying.
I've got the check...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
You sold eight Mountain View?
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Did I...?
To...you know.
I don't know.
I...
What...?
I don't have the power.  I said it.
It's nothing.
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
 Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
Connie.
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
Michael...
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
He's the head of the family.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
I never met them.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
But, you told me yourself...
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
That's off now.
How long does this go on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Goddamn it, where were you?
I can't let him down.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
I know he's in Israel.
Good.  Then you're staying.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
He is, I believe, a brother.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Whose orders are these?
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
His brother came to help him.
On a plane back to Sicily.
You haven't heard me.
The baby I lost...
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Of course you must keep control of your family.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Let him gamble.
I deny his every charge.
I do not.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
They feel cheated.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
I know.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
It still hurt.  A lot.
I didn't mean to...
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
You went to university?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
All right, I guess.
This David's a friend?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
But we have to match the other sketch.
Why not?
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
I want -- I want...
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
I don't hear anything.
Run for what?
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
No.  Definitely not.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Do I have any other choice?
The Great War?
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
I don't remember that one.
Don't move.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's too tight.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I think I'll hang around.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
So what do I do?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
A visitor.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Sure.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
I guess.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Righto.  Let me see.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Who do you think?
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
I don't think so, Detective ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
Double-meaning intended, right?
Right ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
What's that?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Yeah?
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
What color?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
No.
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Nah.
Where'd you find this one?
I gotta get my tool --
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
You look like you lost your sheep ...
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
On account of me.
I left town. I didn't leave you.
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
Very good...
No way ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Cut 'em...
Hear you roar ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Bench seats.
He's gotten involved --
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Not --
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Nods again.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
Shit.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
He heard.
No, no. It's okay.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
I don't want them left back.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
What? Come on!
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
--or a tail--
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
What?
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
I wanted to meet your brothers...
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Fuck her.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
I have about seventy-three...
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Somethin's in my room.
No students work for me.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Fuck do you want?
That you meet with me twice a week--
That's right.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Bullshit.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Yeah, cured polio.
Five.
Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
I live right around the corner.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
"Undermine?"
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
He won't be a failure!
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
I go places, I interact.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Have you read all these books, Will?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
No.
Crayons?
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Why thank you.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Define that.
Not to me, they're not.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
It's not...
Yeah, I think so.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I'll keep in touch.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
What?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No I haven't...
Bullshit.
When?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Like me?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Joe!
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
She got to make it.
How many of you?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Government.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
I ain't gonna run.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
I stay in my own yard.
You ain't got to get sore.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck.  Ever'body set now?  Awright, Al, letta go!
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I'll walk back.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
I'm ready.
You promised, Tommy.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
He was a good man.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Then what, Tom?
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Are you crazy?
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
California, here we come!
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
Yes I do.
You don't...
Oh... really?
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Okay. See you later.
Never better.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
That's it?
I'm a professional killer.
Bad people.
Watched television?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Right.
--She's not dead---
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
You don't understand...
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
Yes.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
No.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Is that right?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Patch him through....
I'll pay.
He didn't.
Never enough.
Tell them my house exploded.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
You too.
I can handle it!
Ever think of moving there full time?
Just make yourself comfortable.
I won't ask you to.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Mom?
Fine!
I didn't know I had to.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
That's not true!
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Good.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
She will if you think she should.
Well, it's good that you're there.
I know. We miss you too.
About what?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Ain't brain surgery.
He thought it was a ghost.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
That must have been pretty special.
I know where he goes.
You just showing off for her!
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
You ever miss it?
Honey... I was always good.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Don't move!
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Was that her top?
Super hero like even.
That's far out!
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
I'm gonna hit you!
Cereal.
Yeah?
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Yeah, mom?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
I told you, I don't play well with others.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
What's this one eat?
Yeah.
Make it our first date.
You're not gonna win.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
I know, I know who wrote it.
You what?
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Gill.
Virus?
Excuse me?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
555-4202.
You're late.
No, you don't understand.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
I do.
Check him out.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
No way. No how.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Rachel!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Its not over yet.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Dear God.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Be here in a minute.
Car trouble?
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
Uh huh.
That's not true. Here I am.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Annie, was that you?
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Go get me a beer.
You all right?
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
I found the car! He's here!
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
See you.
I saw him...
No! Do as I say.
Let's make more popcorn.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
It means... I see.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
Great.
Oh, it's magnificent!
It's really terrible.
No, he called late last night.
But I'm seeing him.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Is this your first job?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I cry at the opera.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Let's take a look.
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Oh, great.
Yeah, sure. 
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
How-how's Frederick?
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
He's got like six gold records.
Yeah.
I know it isn't.
Oh, my God.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Aren't they great?
Mmm.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Was I?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
So?
No, thank you.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
They're in the basement.
Why?
No.
I'm saying it now!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
But not you.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
What, by a st-stranger?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Oooo.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Yeah.
Oh, what do they know?
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
I recall you.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
...in a really horrible way.
I'm okay.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Take our literature...
...read it over, and think about it.
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
What have they got you doing?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
...you...
Then who's buying it?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Not with any certainty we...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
I won't take much of his time.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I'm an orphan.
Waal...
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I have had the honor. 
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
...tell them...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
I don't understand.
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
For approval.
I don't understand.
Because?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Why are you...don't stop...why?
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
I hope so...
When all else fails, Jasper--Gum. Even now in these troubled times,                           ] every child's drug of choice.                               ]
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
That would be a No.
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I just never thought of you in that...
I think your passion is terrific.
I think your condescension is even better.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
What do you want from me?
Very very. The photographs?
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Heather.
No.
Yeah, I just got back.
Give it up girl!
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
S'okay....
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Don't move! I'll get him back!
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
Goddamn Geek!
Get a job.
Sure. Ciao.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Is it hurting, dear?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
is very angry.
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
Mummy!
Him . . .
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
What??
That idiot boarder?
Let's go overseas . . .
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
I'm stumped.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Gwen.
I said she's been missing for-
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
Music to my ears.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Two.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
You mean John Bubber?
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
The homeless!
Turn that thing off.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Were you in it?  In the war?
What picture?
Yes.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Gale...
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
Said he's not an actor.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
What's "cynical"?
Never reach out!
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
As long as you keep remembering why.
I understand that.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Right.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
I've asked him what's wrong.
And?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I could take a cab on the way home.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
What?
Did you hear what he said?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Fuck you, Philip.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Just reduced.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
I have a cold.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
What is it?
I'd like you to see this.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Around.
Is that it?
What?
Sing.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
You?
I hear you.
That is what bothers me.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
You always get to go first.
What do you think?
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
Agreed.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
In the highlands?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Then who's Russell Nash?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Why?
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
Yes -- it is.
Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
How about the cop?
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Give up.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
What hospital?
Canyon Country.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
Yeah.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
How about dog shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
He said something about a girl --
He didn't say.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
What?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I think so.
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Yes.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
What was the response?
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Canadian Club?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
I don't understand.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Get in.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No, sir.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Oh my God!
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
That will take time.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
How do you know?
I will give you my house.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He wants your wisdom.
Homework?
I couldn't help.
Murdered! By whom?
Get in.
Give him time.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
Tell me what it was.
A Volkswagen!
What's wrong?
Anais, it is so good to see you.
The lieutenant wants the register.
When?
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
More to the point. Where's our host?
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
There's always exceptions.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
That's crazy!
It'll have to do.
For chrissake give me a hand!
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
You know everything you do gets me hot.
-- in the act.
-- wit...nesses --
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
I can't remember at the moment.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Please! I need your help.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
I can't comment until I get paid.
What's going on?
Why not?
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
Excuse me?
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
Yes.  It was.
Yes.
We'll get it later.
He's blessing the house.
Well, that all depends.
The place is pretty dusty.
Whatever you say.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
What?
Were you fooling with the power?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Are you ok?
You'll have to settle for turkey.
So what should we do, father?
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
The amulet...
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Right.  Right!
Sorry.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
No.  Thank you.
JP?
Really?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
I miss you too.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
"Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
Yes way.
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
That's what you theenk.
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
How long were you in?
Uh....old badminton injury.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Wha.....
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Snappy.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
Adenoids?
He didn't offer you money.
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
The couch, please.
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
I'm sure I --
Smitty.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
What a beautiful thought.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Now, Aim --
Oh Norville, I --
I don't know...
Tell me about it.
I --
Huh?! But, buddy --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
Sir?
But, sir!
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Yeah, tell me about it.
Thank you, Alma.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Where?
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
But it's so far away...
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
It's my day off.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
Yes, thank you.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
What about her?
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Up the organization!  Bastard.
That shirt?
Stuffed and baking.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Gotcha.
What?
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
C'mon.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
You know, dah--
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Darn it, Dave.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Well, we can talk about it.
Nobody.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Oh Wendy.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It's really quite all right.
Social work?
How'd you know?
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Yes.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
See ya.
Moisture! Moisture!
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Just be careful.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Geometry?
Sure, anything but this English.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Greetings, Charles.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
And?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
The ones you built?
Yeah.
Communist Viet Cong.
Vodka?
You never tasted the stuff?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Actually...
I don't remember.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm always all business.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
The other guy?
Good to see you, too, Randy.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
Thought you wanted something fun...
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
Did you have sex with her?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Told you I could write an ending.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Ah! You have questions?
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
Then blame the one who made her...
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
I can't save her.
Louis, I swear I did not.
I didn't realise.
Is this my birthday?
And if I cut my hair again?
What have you done?
He'll never let us go.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Not yet.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
And no one knows but us...
It's only mortal death.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Why should I be?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
I want it!
You've just done it -
Yes...
You have fed. You were made for this...
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
What are you saying?
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
The story about stakes through the heart?
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
What about a radio?
Who? Who is here?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
The guy looks dead.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Karla! You promised.
Yes.
No.
Some.
It's too late for that.
No, you're not.
Why are you being like this?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
Ben Willis.
Wait, it's Nancy --
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
What?
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
How much?
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
So why are you still here?
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
Hey -- shut up, okay?
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
All the graves?
No.  She shall not be left here.
Sleep well.
What an odd question!
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
She is dead — at peace.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
I don't understand you.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
When you make sense I'll listen.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
All right –– all right.
Go through with what?
Suicide.
Well, who are you, then?
No, of course not.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
A boy?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Hiya, George!
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Nice girl, Mary.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
And all's fair in love and war?
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
No.
Ummmm . . .
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff I was talking about.
Say, where's Mother?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
She was here first.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Nothing.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
How do you do.
That way, huh?
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
They're not my children.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Okay –– what can we lose?
Beautiful.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Where'd you get that dress?
Thank you.
My baby.
Left them at the office.
What plates?
What?
Shut up.
Over here!
Happy to do it.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
What camera?
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
You can't stop me.
Okay, okay.
All of us thank you, okay?
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
You don't make enough.
The Shark's mouth.
And sound.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
So there's one around here.
So's a donut.
It's an island.  Got to run.
Nothing, huh?
Terrific.
Do you?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
I'll give notice.
Going out.
We're alone.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
What's daddy doing?
Dad!  Dad!
Help!  Help!
Who'd you ask?
Double nope!
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Anything.  Anything.
Mike?  Our Mike?
Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Name it.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Yeah.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
You buying?
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
What is it, 97 days?
Yeah.
My imagination isn't that good.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Yes.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
After what happened to us?
Thank you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Well, that's why you got it.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Let's hope he knows that.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Some miss all their shots.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
Not good enough.
I don't know, what else is there?
Don't you dare.
Can't help it... ahh...
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Always do.
It's not closing, Mike.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Don't bother Hoagie....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
We need beer....
Turn it off....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
It's beginning....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
Come on, I'll show you around.
I'm fine....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
Where do I pull off...?
The plane's turning....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
My vision is perfect....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Aye, aye, Captain....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Still chasing fish?
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Put me down....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
When I signed on....
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Maybe it's gone....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Stop that!
You don't like my voice...?
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
What does that mean?
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
What do you mean, Ross?
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
I haven't got it.
You want me to stop the car?
Car accident.
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
No .. You didn't know that ..
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Hey ..
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
<u>You</u> put it in there.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Why not? You heard my voice?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
My hands?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Really? What did he say?
I'm blind because my father drank.
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
I think I've found a hand.
One of the accountants.
Jerry!  Do something --
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
I see what you're saying.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
No no, I know --
Absolutely.
I just got goosebumps.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
-- especially one like this.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Will you marry me?
What --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't need you to "stick."
I don't know --
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Good.
Please, if I start talking --
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
I might call you later!
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
It's a risk.
That's an answer.
Why not --
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
You wanted smaller.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
What'd I say?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
What?
What's a bad idea?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Nothing.
No, it's...
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
You couldn't have made that jump.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Who's that?
Here!
What about Eric?
Just hold on.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
Really?  What do you do there?
I try not to.
The last of my breed.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
You should.
No. I couldn't see.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
But you never came across just one.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
I don't even know this woman.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Where does it say that?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
She's with Sarah!
I think she's with Sarah!
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
Why did you come here?
What?!
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
You think this is all a joke?
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
No.
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
Oh my God.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
The - - agility.  You're right!
Not just every six weeks.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Alan!
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Alan?
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Listen, ahh - -
Tim, are you okay?
Yes it is.
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Nope.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
The kids okay?
What kind of opinions?
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
Ken, we've been through this...
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
Great.
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
That's open to debate.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
That doesn't make sense.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
You're not going to be there?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
-- In what sense?
No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
Yes.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
I gave it to him yesterday.
... My ... social situation?
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Have you looked?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
Then why haven't I been --
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
Amerika!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
It's ... lovely.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Yeah.
What's that?
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Sure dear, yes.
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
Look -- could I use your phone?
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Will you let me go then?
Mm.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
-- OK?
I go on rounds.
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Try some other ways. 
Thanks.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Don't worry.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I don't like getting splashed.
You and I -- a relationship.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
About what?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
What's in it?
Not unusual.
Did she talk about him to you?
Has she talked with you since prison?
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
No.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
Playing.
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
On earth.
Yeah?
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
That's okay...
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
You mean for good?
No.
What else wasn't there?
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
And what is your present salary?
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Objection!
And did you have a close personal relationship?
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Was he unfaithful?
I...I don't know...
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
I suppose...
Yes.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
What about Billy?
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
What?
Beautiful.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Murray.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
I'm going to take it.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Do you want the kid or don't you?
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Ted?  Are you there?
John, what if she kidnaps him.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
Joanna said that?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Ted, I just heard...
Please, Thel...
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
I know.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
Thank you. Please sit.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Then, we shall meet.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
What do you think?
Roughly five thousand men.
No. This war is almost over.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Always.
Me?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
No, Holiness.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Hmm.
I see that.
Thank you.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
And you like me.
You're crawling around like a--
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
He never said "go".
Bastard bit my chopper.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Could we have intercourse?
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
You flew up here because your boss--
Good.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Excuse me?
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Let's get away from the shore.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Calm down.
Look.
Alright, Jack!
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
Okay.
Keep firing!
No.
Good thinking.
Obviously I was wrong!
Other than to eat us?
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
Gee.
What the hell?
Yes.
Else.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Why not?
Sometimes.
I don't know! Get me out!!
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Starling -
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Dr. Lecter...
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Sometimes you do.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
I didn't.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Who killed your patient?
A moth... How did you predict that?
Thank you, Clarice.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Thank you so much.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Our father? Did you see my father?
There was none!
There was no letter.
You do not know what you are saying!
It can be dangerous...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What?!
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Fort Edward, then?
Excuse me...
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
What else?
Fire!!!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
France.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
I'm not a doctor.
Why Sixpack?
Was there such a thing?
He did.
Fuck your orders!
How do you know it was Williams?
You screw around like that again and--
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
How much time does that give us?
He's not at his station.
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Okay.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
It...almost got you.
The infirmary?...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
I'm going to try to remove it.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Right.
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Where did he get a hundred grand?
They were going to pay, then?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
You had better be careful.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Furry muff, let's go.
Er well, yes we do.
Hit the fuckers.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
What do you mean, me?
I'll only be a minute.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
For half a million?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Seven hundred each.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
So?
I can't take any more school.
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I-I can do the job, sir.
You really want to know, sir?
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Charley Wade.
That badge--
Colt Peacemaker.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You look good--
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You were in a fight--
No. You?
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Go out through the back.
So they stayed in Florida?
So I'm part-Indian?
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Right.
You going to get married?
Yeah?
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Yeah. I bet he would.
Have we had trouble there before?
Substance abuse?
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
Why would you want to do that?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Quien es? [Who is it?]
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
We don't need a new jail.
Right.
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
I got an idea what happened.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Thank you.
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
Okay? He's not here?
That was the night he disappeared?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Time marches on.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
The shooter local?
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
No--
Me neither.
You know who it was?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Runnin' numbers illegal.
Nix.
Right.
Isn't that French for something?
That's so cool.
He's a priest?
I could scoop them out.
Be ready.
And are you afraid?
Why not?
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
He was the real thing, right?
Stuff?
No.
Quaid and Jennifer--
I... have... to.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Sure.
Heaven and Hell?
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
We've never met.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Philip Swann?
Are you sure?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I tried to pay you off.
Yes...
Was he taking a lot of risks?
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
Yes.
Jesus!
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
No!
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Ok.
Try twenty-five.
Ok.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
You're possessive.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
But, I'm mean.
No one ever tells you that...
We should get you to the doctor.
You think so?
Yeah, look at that thing.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Yes, no.
Yes?
Oh?
Do you like massage?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Do you want I send it to your room?
What?
Bye.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
It's probably trivial.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
What happened?
When did they find her?
I found the pentacle.
Peter, are you okay?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You heard voices, you know you did.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Trick him.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
Where is she now?
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
I can't eat before a game.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
That's ridiculous.
The blue.
Uh-huh.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Why are you up?  Get in bed.
This brother from my college.
Oh, great.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
I know.  But chances are...
Didn't have to try very hard.
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
I know this.  What do you want?
A ride home.
Who's Spalding?
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Yeah.
You do see me standing here, right?
Quit.
My court, I go first.
I wanted you to.
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
I...can't.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
Woman...
What the hell's going on?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
We won the championship.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Figured it was something like that.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Wow.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Then why are you so upset?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
So?
And what happens when you lose?
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You know, people.
You came out early.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I just told you.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
I don't know.
ooohhhhhh no.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
It was scary though.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
LAPD. Open the door.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
ok.
You just move in here?
I don't have a boyfriend.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Well...is that illegal?
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Eight o'clock?
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
What?
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I'm sorry --
That was so great what you just said.
Say what you want and you'll see --
You alone in there?
Have you ever been there?
I don't know.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
It's ok, boy.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I'm sick.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
Yes.
Your teeth are fine.
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
No.
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Are you close?
Right.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
They wouldn't?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
When did he go off chemo?
About three weeks ago.
There's no disturbance.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
What happend to you?
I'm sorry.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Are you alright?
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
Yeah.
Do you know the answer to this?
Did you ever touch her?
I don't know.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
I have to go.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Hi.
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
818-753-0088.
Do you have that?
Maybe.
Shut up -- shut up --
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Should be one-thirty.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
..sorry...
This happens....this is something that happens.
That is good.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
How can I serve you in this?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Die?  What...?
Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
To kill the king.
The King killed my son!
The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
I decided it this morning.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
... The ball... Continue.
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
Great. Well that changes a lot...
Fine -
Gotta come from somewhere...
And who are you?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
No...
Only on dates?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Yeah.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Ditched you?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
I wouldn't presume to try.
That's when it happened?
Book code?
Where?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
Get him to Atlanta.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
To recover the mind set.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I'll pick you up in...
Don't talk to me!!
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Let me stick this in the black hole.
I'm fine.
Yes.
No.
Yes...
Do you see?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Absolutely,
Dr. Chilton.
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Hi, Linda. ..
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Yeah...
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
'Intimate? !"
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue is cold.
Will...
Will?  You could come up here.
You got a deal...
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I figured I'd ask you...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
I want your opinion.
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
What do you want?
Pretty well.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I hope you have a second chance...
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Hi... am I late?
Hi... am I late?
I'm here, ain't I?
You don't know the real me.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
I know.  It's her fault.
If you get caught using that --
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Hear what?
No!
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
But what if...?
Go!  Now!
It's an honor.
Be what?  Be real?
Far from it.
Show me.
The beginning?
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
He is the One.  He is the One!
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
You're the Oracle?
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Who?
What?
Of what?
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
We can't leave him!
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
You're not far from Cypher.
Be careful.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
Jewish...
Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
Kennedy.
I don't like loading crates.
Did you see them run!
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Come on.
Good idea.
Ok...that's it.
Yeah, where's the rest?
Fine.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
What did he do?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Sure...He lives there?
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Well...no.
Hi, Allison --
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
'Goddam party'!
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
But what?
What will I tell Annie?
Drew, you're out of line.
He'll wait --
I didn't say.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Then why did you bring it up?
A voice?
Sounds good.
It's going to be great --
You have a way with words.
As close as a deal could be.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
What are their feelings?
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
Thanks, Quince.
'It's up to Joe'?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Make it time.
You loved back?
I am.
Rass!
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
It's so very nice to see you again.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Thanks.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
No.
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't have any.
Excuse me?
Has her pain abated?
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
More than you love peanut butter?
-- Yes?
Thank you for loving me.
You think so?
No.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
You've got a deal.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So can I.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
It's all yours.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Yeah.
Say again?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
An indictable offense.
That's me.
You fill the bill, Bill.
I don't!
I'm sorry --
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Drew told me.
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
Uh oh --
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Then what is it?
I would.
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Burt.
As requested.
Seen you together, that's all.
Interested in buying one?
Don't say anything else.
Quiet!
Yes.
Tell me about her again.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Deals?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Did you?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
What?
Thanks.
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
I enjoy it.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
No! Should I?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Give me your keys.
You like it? Let's trade.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
No, you won't.
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * We found him and you killed him.				  *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.
No. You took them out.						  *
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Oh, yeah...
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Two main players plus three.
My end?
Make it 40%.
The Keys?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
No.
I insist.
That's right.
Good samba dancing...?
Zero risk.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Do I need it?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
Sit.
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
'Cause she will tell you.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
I would never doubt you.
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
He did volunteer one time...
You set this up!
What...?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
I mean, dammit, where you live?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
You like it? Take a look.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Don't need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
What?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Don't make me laugh.
Stop shitting me, man!
Billy?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Stupid.
But just...
Something like that. Cigarette?
Beats working.
What's your father do?
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
What's that?
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
You know where it is?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
Oh, Jesus!!
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
So?
Right.
I was just late.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Just do it!!
The scent won't last...
That's it?
She used a baster.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How long...?
--my number one fan.
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
Will I be able to walk?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
What's it about?
Pretty rough so far.
It's fine.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
The Sistine Chapel?
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Perfect.
Yes.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
You can--you have the "gotta"--
...have to wait.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Not even a hint?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
You really think so?
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
You don't know?
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
Yes, he is.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Answer me a couple things?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Newspapers?
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
From her point of view or mine?
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
More like two-two point two million.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
What are you talking about?
Right.
Not for seven more minutes.
How much longer before you can reach him?
No.  Should I?
Uh-huh.
- right..
Do what?
You didn't do that badly.
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Ethan Hunt.
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Which is?
Of what?
Sean Ambrose, for one.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Affirmative.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.
No...
Like what?
Like?
You were there.
What did you think of him?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
And then what?
Yes, I gathered as much.
Yes.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
You're right, of course.
All ten million.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
We did what we had to do.
Is this the only way?
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Yeah.  I follow you.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Higher.
Jim we canít.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Very well.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Of course I can hear you.
Jack you're so wicked.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Again?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I didn't give you away the first time.
He did?
What are you doing here?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
And what did they say?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Stupid.
Seven years ago.
No!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
What?
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
You ruined my life.
I'm in love with you!
Yeah. It smells like snow.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Yeah, I'll be in.
Yes?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
How near is she to death?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
A month from today?
And we'll sell the house.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What! How do you know?
No. Are you drunk?
No more he's not.
WHAT!! She was dying!
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I don't know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Talk to him.
Good.
I am alone in the world.
None of your business.
What do you do?
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I'm too old for you.
Sure.
Yes.
It's Cosmo's moon.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Does wood sink in water?
Yes!
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Through ... We found them.
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
Of course.
Now - go!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
You said it again!
No, no ... not "is"!
'Tis but a scratch.
You're a liar.
Had enough?
Course I have.
You'll what ... ?
Come Here.
You're a looney.
OF course, my Liege ...
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
What does it say?
A Grail?
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
The nose?
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
I feel happy... I feel happy.
What is your favorite colour?
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Back to your bed!  At once!
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
I didn't.
Not down south you don't.
Not bad, not bad.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I can't let her down now, Archie.
Louder, girl!
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Yeah.
It is quite late enough.
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Is that the Queen's request?
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
If you hunt, you kill.
Aye.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
He thought so, yes.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
So?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Of course.
Cold is good!
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
And now I am back.
I have a letter, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
We are talking...
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Laurie's.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Yes...
That way.
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
I'm going home.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Very pleased to meet you.
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Can you tell me what happened?
But it said #12.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
What do you mean?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Okay.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Those men in front, in the car.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
But I want to.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you... thank you very much.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Could be unrelated.
Find out who they are?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Damn, that's a long drive.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
How long till the room fills ?
He hired you to build this place ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
That's a shame.
Bye....
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
I don't help criminals.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
That's cute asshole.
Don't have to tell me twice.
When will that be ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Yes sir.
Thank you, sir.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
I don't know.....
I'll see that bet.
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
Yes.
Thank you.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Ohhhhh.
This is California, anything is possible.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
I don't even know your name.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Well you know what I mean.
Great.
Her favorite poet.
What??
Hi honey.
Totally groovy huh?
We have a baby?
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
Does she?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.

Special effects?
I'll try.
That's okay.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
There's water in your bathroom.
I won't.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
What, you think the guy should change his name?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Boyfriend?
In the tar??
Big deal.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Bye.
A secret, I like that.
He was caressing.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Well maybe for you.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Is there milk in them already?
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
What do you mean?
He's so tiny.
I know, look at his little hands.
He is?
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
All right, here.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
This guy bonking you?
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
The boss is watching us...
I'm impressed.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
Kinda like men.
Is there enough room?
Goodnight.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Soon honey, soon.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
There were just too many of 'em.
Do you miss her?
I'm very nervous.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Will you tell her I came by?
Sure.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
How much does it cost?
Does he love her?
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
I'm hemorrhaging.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Okay, get in to bed.
It'll bleed.
You have no personality.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
What do you want it for anyway?
I am running faster!!
Sure.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Okay.
Would you think of me?
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I honestly wish I could...
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
The wandering sportswriter.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
I have a suggestion...
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
That was Thursday.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
You win.
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
He won't get mad, huh?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
... unless he has a hump.
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
You've met her parents.
Endearingly absent-minded.
She finds him "personable."
Till the gas ran out.
Never can tell.
The night we met.
Yes.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Well, it happens.
This is where I proposed.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Grand Old Opera --
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I said 'no!'
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
Stop it!
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
I'll just be in here.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Who's that?
How do you know?
You must really like him.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
You in music?
Nashville.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Does their hair fall out?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
When did you start singing?
About three years.
No, I don't.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
That's not quite what I had in mind.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
Wow!
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
I'm not sure...
What?
They said go see the chaplain.
You're not.
Did it break?
Hello.
He is to a lot of people.
You always live there?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
Which do you recommend?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I can appreciate that.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
Ain't love grand.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Do you have a back up.
Ready.
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
Do you miss Mallory?
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Let me have the keys.
We'll all be killed.
So, what now?
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
I do, too.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Where do the air ducts lead?
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
And where do you keep Mickey?
Wayne Gayle!
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
When do you want the assembly?
But you'll never be whole again.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
And his age?
You must be new in town.
No.
No thanks.
Take it easy.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
What?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
I didn't know you had one.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
What happened, Duff?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah, that's so.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Uh-huh. Why?
My kids want me to teach them.
You will.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
There's nothing to say.
Okay.
Better get him to a hospital.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
I said, she's in great shape.
How often is that?
Well, what're you going to do?
How 'you gonna live?
Okay.
Who is?!
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I doubt it.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Oh yeah?
'Musta knocked her up.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Omar--
Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
Of course.
Don't play with me.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
What are you talking about?
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Who got you into this?
Never heard of him.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Case.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
What's my end?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What?
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
What is it?
Shut up.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
Yeah.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
Very romantic.
Hidden camera.
Wings?
Sometimes opposites attract.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Oh. Right.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Are you in special ed?
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
Sorry. Forgetful.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I just can't look at you the same way.
We're very evolved.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Well, a ball player.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Only the wet ones.
Let me look at your eye...
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
About not finding any bogey men?
I'll get over it.
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
yeah, I had a bad night.
There's nothing to figure out.
No.  I'm okay.
All of them.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I'm sure you would.
Hi Mom.
He's full of shit.
Mom?
Don't hold your breath.
Jennifer --
Deal.  Thanks.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
I -- I think so!
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
I don't do that shit.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Anything?
Oh God.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Well, we've got --
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
We're gonna try.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
They used to keep a spare key.
No.  We're alone.
A sad choice.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
My God.
Cooling down.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
And then I... right.
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
Fine.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
You abide by rules like that?
You've got to go.
I have thought about you.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Eleven.
Okay.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
You do?
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
But... wait... there are things to say.
What's the thing?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Does the girl have a name?
... get fired.
I never fancied you much actually...
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
And we intend to use them!
No -- it's my 22nd.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Blimey.  What's that?
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
What's your name?
Well, fire away.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Which was?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
I-I-I...
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Who? Tell me!
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Atta boy, Cheswick!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Shhh...
Hey, what's that?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
That!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
So why are you talking to him?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
I'm busting outta this place.
Hear what?
When?
Who told you that?
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
'Kay, Mac!
You're on!
How much ya wanna bet?
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Come an' see.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Huh?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
That!
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
He's dead.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Your hair... is perfect.
We found each other, didn't we?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Does he love you?
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Or Hustler.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Oh.  That's nice.
No.  Are you're leaving?
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Oh, hello.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
So?...
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
No...  I can just tell.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
Only what?
Sorry.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Polo.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
I never even got to be single.
I meant about my idea.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
What?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
When you could've found one in America.
What about Larry?
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
I thank you.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
She didn't give me a chance.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
It'll do.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
But my own kid bro—
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Boss loader!
I know. I know.
See! You don't understand!
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
What for?
And if you don't?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
What for?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Go ahead, wear it.
What I did to Joey.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
You'll work.
I told you lay off.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hey look-
Nothing happened, Johnny.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
Nolan... .
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
What do you mean?
You do?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
Ahh, she will be yours.
The moon is almost gone!
Is there time?
Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You know better than that.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Glenn Michaels.
Why not?
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Just that she got away.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
Uh-huh...
Let's go to Detroit.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You find out?
Yeah, I did.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
It was an unusual experience.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
What do you want to bet?
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
I'll need a last known address.
Not until recently.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
Is that right?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Yeah...
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
So do you.
He killed a police officer.
Why not?
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
Why are you mad?
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Okay.  How many going out?
I know what you're talking about.
It's a big house.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
You gonna write me a check?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
You busted out?
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
You're not?
And is Foley a part of this?
I'm freezing my ass off.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
You're not my type.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
I see that.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
None I'd like to share.
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
He was that good?
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Home of the brave!
I didn't mean it.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
So what are you saying?
Come on!
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
I can't make it.
Yes you can.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
We're all going away.
How did you?...
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Refresh my memory.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Who?
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Just take a look at it. 
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
I've got to go now.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
But I'm remembering the future.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
The hat business is in trouble.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
How do you feel?
I'm home now.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Silicon is from sand.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
What do they do up there?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
Anywhere but here.
He pissed me off.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Right here, Mom...
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
Allright. Calm down.
K-R-O-one.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Andy?
You're going to the office?!
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
Correct. I don't.
Rayisha.
Thank you.
Arline?
Let's find you a drink.
Correct.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Opera?
What impressed you about him?
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
Sure thing.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Yes.
Yes.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Yes.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Thank you.
Yes.
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
I might.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Who?
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Why should I?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
Jesus.
Charles...
Charles...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<u>Listen</u>.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
What, switch what?
Only around humans.
Probably right.
Like what?
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
I never said I was.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
You <u>don't</u> see.
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
I'm born-again.
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Not staying in here another....
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Nice embellishment.
What do you care?
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
Him.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
But I'm not prepared to die.
Try telling them our names.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
What is it?
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
I think you're making a mistake.
He wouldn't leave her.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
I don't know.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Twelve hundred years ago.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Where's Elias come from?
...See them go down? Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford! 
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
You really think so... us?
I volunteered.
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Right...
Very nice Mitchell turns.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
That's all there is.
There wasn't any plane.
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
From you, I like it.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Killaine...
This must have cost a fortune.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Do you think I was faking?
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
It is?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I don't want to talk.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Points very straight to her.
What does he see?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
I know that.
You asked for it.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Got the information on you?
If I can get off.
Quite sure you had no motive?
I never notice the view after the first week.
That must hurt.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Information.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Lay off, can't you?
A little something on account perhaps?
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
You can find out.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
So?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Are you always this witty?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Now, you're being beastly.
How do you do, sir.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
I don't know, sir.
Yes, sir.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
Of course.
I say YES!
What a shame.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
I think you'll do very well.
Well, we were just...
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Yes, please.
I thought it was tremendous.
Oh yes?
I might.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
The torture of small children--
I'll ring you.
You're a piece of shit
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Oh, I see.
Terrific.
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
You're so famous now.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
They won't let you in without one.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
My man!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
SHIT!!
Surf conditions okay?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Shrimp and fries.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
What do you mean?
Go on.
Who's our back-up on this?
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We're not going.
You know you can't win this one.
What, Sergeant?
We both got scores to settle.
Hawkins?
There's no sign of it.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
He's not really my uncle.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
Hope to be?
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Not exactly.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
What?
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Just a romantic, that's you.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
"Occupational hazard".
What?  Why?
Don't drown.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Did you buy some clothes?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
I think you'll approve.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Come with me?
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
What if someone tries to steal it?
Huh?
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
It was a business decision.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I'm up.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Vivian.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Gently!!
What?
And a good thing too.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How many could you handle?
The body?
-- wait, just wait --
-- well, when does it get good?
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Sire.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
And our assets?
-- offer me money --
-- power too -- promise me that --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
We're really in a terrible rush.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Thank you.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Then why are you smiling?
Okay.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
"I want to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
I have hurt your feelings.
Where?  What?
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
What was I saying?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
No way out.  No way out.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Shut up.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
With whom?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
We can't play today?
Oh, the best one.
All right.  All right.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Heil you know who!
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
I mean in show business.
What do you do best?
We can't... we keep our money there!
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Tell me all about her.
Very early. Dawn.
No! Of all...
Anyone at home?
Someone is sitting in that window.
Now, look...!
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
I don't believe it.  Do you?
Can I trade in my car and take another?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Of course not. Please.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Where?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
You've led a charmed life.
You want me to stay here?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Why can't I go out there with you?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Yes.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
Sam! No!
Los Angeles.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
No, not like me.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Norman.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Now what?
Please.
Norman took a wife?
He's already been.
At this hour?
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Fine.
And now that your mother's dead?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Shut up! Shut up!
Just before she died she came to--
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Maybe you're right.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
That's it. You get it quick.
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
There's no child here.
But ... the dogs...
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I don't agree with you.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
The body of Joan Gale!
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
It happens that I'm the law.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
Almost certain.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
How's every little thing?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Do you know George Winton?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
Darned if I don't! 
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Yes.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Dad...
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
But who were they?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Buddy, you're just a child.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
I don't want to know...
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Okay.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Please do.
Yes, we know her.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Quarter of twelve.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Boys? You say to me boys?
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
The hell we can't.
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Is anything wrong?
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Yes, sir.
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
She has other things to do, Dave.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
More history, Rose.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
That wasn't my fault.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
What day is it?
It doesn't say that.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
We have to find Kittle.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
Bummer.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
Let me see that...  Not bad.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
I'm well aware of that.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
All right. Stand by.
I can't kill my own father.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I'm trying!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
You, too.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Oh, no.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
So, you have accepted the truth.
If that is your destiny.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Makes you cry
Was all I had to say
Now I
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...Fine.
I don't think you're a bum.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
I'll call your brother.
It's not that --
What?
...What?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
-- The legs.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Paul.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Get outta my life both of ya's.
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
No doctor!
One more round.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Don't like yours neither.
Why?
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it, I'm broke.
You think I don't hear things?
I feel bad about walkin'.
Why?
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
...Tomato?
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
When was they here?
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
See what?
It ain't your locker no more.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
I'll do okay.
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
Do you feel you have a chance?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
He's a Toon... who cares?
It's all yours.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
They?
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
I don't work in Toontown.
So's the job.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Yeah?
Good idea.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
'Tis he.
I'll not endure him.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Hold Daughter!
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Ahhh!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is she a Capulet?
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
Of course.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
You first, Edvard.
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I don't have it with me...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Is that right?
Like Larry or Swede.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Do what?
You think?
Closest and oldest.
Do you have a good answer?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You slept with the fucker!!
I'm alright.  And you?
I hear you.
Oh, you would have done great.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Because...I know.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the right thing to do.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
And how do you figure we do that?
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Then we're screwed.
Uh huh.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
You deserve it is the occasion.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Mm-hmm...
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything...specific?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Why?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Forget it.
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
What?
You've done without it long enough, ma.
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's right.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
You sound like that all the time.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Take it!
Why did you help me?
Steamed dumplings?
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
No.  But I'll help you.
I'm fine.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Shut up!
Sir, I can explain.
I know, but --
They asked for the best street man I had.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
He was just doing his job.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
I was being polite.
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
Did you make the plate?!
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Stooly.
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Going into the restaurant.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
He is the situation.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
He is very good.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Of course.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
And you defending her?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
You'll answer my questions?
We think so.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Cindy the manicurist.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Ya think?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Not eight...
Good boy, Port Hole.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Nope.
You don't love me, is that it?
He's got a houseboat.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Does it have wheat in it?
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I should say something in this about magic.
Yes.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Definitely.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
No, I'm not. 
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Destiny takes a hand.
You know.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Like... clockwork.
Magic.
Why not?
Right, right.
It's Y. O. H.
It's a spice rack.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Sure.  Looking good.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
I'm starting to notice that.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Good.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Oh, right.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
It was all they had.
You did?
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
You're welcome to one.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
They are singing for me.
What has it got me, your union?
No, no ...
He'll have it good. Some day.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
I'm going back tomorrow.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
But honey ...
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
I thought maybe you forgot...
What attitude?
That's it?
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
Shhh.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
Not even a guess?
First rate, ain't it?
Leave me out of this.
Ouch.
Nothing.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Never heard of him.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You really need to lighten up.
What is wrong with you?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
It's me.
Danny, it's not what you think.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
You're going to have to explain that one.
No. I'm good.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
When? When did you ever see me use?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
If you say so.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Why do you say that?
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
It's not my place.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Tell me what?
I was trying to score some dope.
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Jesus.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
What deal?
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
DASHES across the street.
Pass.
I've been humming it.
That only leaves three.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
We can't leave it here.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
See to it.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
Because he's guilty.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
That's right.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Going out as friends.
C'mon, just do it.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
You like it?
Oh yeah!
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
I'm fine.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, I love him.
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Yes, I...
I made their lives better.
Thank you very much.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Hmmm....
I'll go.
Twisted?
Job?  Being a great date.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Come on.
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Be friends?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
You need to study?
Yeah, uh-huh.
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
What do you want?
Not right now, thanks.
Fine Lloyd.
Yeah.  Honey?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
Hey.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
I don't know.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Oskar, please -
I'm sorry to hear that.
I just told you.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Something they can hold in their hands.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Christmas presents.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Stop it...
I'm losing you.
No, it's me.
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
You could start with an apology.
What?
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
But you’ll never get away with it.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
He hates Oliver Stone.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I think you're all an act.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
That's not the way it's done.
Yeah, right.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Don't worry...
Just in case...
Watch your back.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
But she's standing right next to you.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
But...
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Don't panic.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Oh yeah, how?
What does this have to do with Sid?
There's someone here who wants to help.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
They've got her!
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
And who is that?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Need to get in that building?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Who?
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Huh, fine.
Who's this?
What?  What movie?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
No one's saying you did.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Yeah...
No...
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Are you alone in the house?
Who are you trying to reach?
I think you have the wrong number.
What's that noise?
You have to have a favorite.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
No.
That's not what you said.
What do you think I said?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
No...
But you're doing so well.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Mind if I join you?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
I'll get my camera.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
He's her boyfriend.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Have you contacted the bureau?
What is it? Where's Casey?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
I'll send you a copy.
I want to talk to you.
Many times.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Why would she lie about it?
What's your favorite scary movie?
So where are you?
Right here.
What am I doing?
LEAVEMEALONE!
...out at the airport...
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
He came to make up.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
What happened?
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Do they know who did it?
Whatever. Just hurry.
Just like old times, ain't it?
It's alright. I'll get it.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Come on, let's rock.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
Give it to me.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
Announcing what?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what?  This victim...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Yeah, that's true.
Why?
NO!
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
What the fuck is going on here?!
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
For now.
Guessing at this point is useless.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Okay.  But, what?
Bear with me.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
The fingerprints.
Oh, it's alright.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
Sure.  Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer?  Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
We have probable cause now.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
Slut.
Wait!
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
How should I know?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
It was, I tell you!
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Yes sir...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
Now mount up, son...
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Yes, sir.
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Good night...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
It's what I'm countin' on.
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
It isn't fair...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
You?
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Thank you.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Do I look like it that much?
I've killed my husband!
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Tenth floor.
Very funny.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
It's good.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Lady?
Wait!  Will you desist!
What is the chief part?
Most interesting.
That's me.
It's a comedy.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Who are you?
God be praised!  Locked?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
I have. And chinks to show for it.
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Is the day so young?"
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Your Majesty.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
"Parting is such sweet sorrow…"
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"She speaks.
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
I like her.
You have opened the playhouses?
But the plague
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
Who is there?
Can you love a player?
It is strange to me, too.
Oh
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh, but it is mine too!
Then I will go with you.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
and thus unable to declare her love
My lord.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Your aunt?
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
What of her bosom?
A man, my lord?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
What?
I'm only asking what you think.
Can I show you something?
Think about it.
You think so?
I can't do it.
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
After.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
This is just an informal discussion.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Yes.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Really?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Alex.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
Not usually this drunk.
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
You're right.
His car's still there.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
For ever and ever.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
No, I don't.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Your painful groin?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Where he can't get it?
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
What?
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes.
No.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
No.
If I think you're lying --
That one, last week.
Would you like to come in?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
No.
It's an improvement.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
That's okay too.
No.
What?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
-- What?
What kind of treatment?
Your husband?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Uh-uh.
No.
It isn't?
God, I adore you.
Hello.
Did you hear me?
... yeah.
No kidding.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
No.
That you're just like your mother.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
You promised you'd do the show.
Can't you do it out here?
I'd cut it...
Why not?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Sit down!
I am you, you little bastard.
He never stopped.
Mmmm --
Lester's on his way.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What?
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- Otis?
Great, great. I hope you make it.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
Keep moving --
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're different.
I am?
Yeah, baby.
Great.
Hey, I'm, you know --
When can I talk to you?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Going where?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
I'll call you.
Never mind. Where've you been?
How many?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Please!... that's not like you.
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
You're right.
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Oh, hey...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Have a drink.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Wasn't sure it was you.
I'm coming over.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Yes.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I am?
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jackie, what're you doing?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Well, what is it, honey?
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
But you have problems?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
How much?
It's been so long I don't how long?
C'mon.
... Mmm-hmmm.
But why Egypt?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Johnny!
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
-- just wonderful.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes, Dad.
Dad?
Do you like this hotel?
Yes, Dad.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Okay...oh!
I won't make any noise.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
No.
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Sure.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Fine.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
A nigger.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Nice to meet you.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
What line of work are you in now?
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Hmm, nice.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Which room was it?
Stay away from me.
Yes?
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
All the best people.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Thank you, Susie.
Fine.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
You're a real booger, you know it?
Rattling. Rustling.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Good.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I told you!
I saw what I saw.
But Uncle Al! You said-
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
SING!
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
With love.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
What is it, Betty?
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
Enough jabber.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Mary Robert.
I knew that.
A cigarette?
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
It's true!
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
You were unhappy?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
No food?
My what?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
What?
But -- why?
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
Get a stenographer.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Like what?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
I am?
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
Hail, Mary.
They open a window.
Yeah...
Neither did you!
She's praying.
We're losing it.
He's kind.
It's better than springtime.
But, Bishop...
Many have.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
... Brom Bones...
You need rest.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Hmm?  See them?
Well... that might be... helpful.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
I shall, gladly.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
The militia?
I'm sure I don't know.
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Stay back.
What does it mean?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
No.  They are all missing.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
I know.  Hold on.
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Yes, he does.  May I try?
You made this, and the drawings?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
I do not know.  Away.
He moves too fast.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Use caution.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
The Horseman.  Yes.
Sit.
Doctor, he is awake.
She is guilty.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, what did you want?
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Yeah.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Why? Hi, Karl.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Why not? It died?
So it died when it come out?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Yessir.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Mama?
Huh?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I reckon.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Yeah.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I know.
Karl is a guy guy?
I'm sorry.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
It's my birthday.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
What about for you?
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
No, he's not. You are.
Anything good?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
She looks just like you.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
No you're not.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Sure thing. See you later.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And how much are these?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Well what?
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
Yeah, I can believe it.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Eight-thirty?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Where did you get that thing?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
It wasn't my fault.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
Fries?
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Why?  If they could never take title.
Is that your third question?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And why.  Is that?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
He didn't want to lose any more.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Fell.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Does it now?
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
No.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Not in those words.
I can't speak for him.
That's all he said.
Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Yes.  And that one, too.
I suppose you want a tip?
Funny?  In what way?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
But suppose it doesn't?
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
Knock it off, will you?
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Me?  After Sugar?
Don't get burned, Daphne.
WHAT?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Like what?
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
We're not on the pier yet -
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
Anything wrong?
And your head is hot.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Yes.  For a whole year.
What's the big idea?
Let me carry one of the instruments.
You must be quite a girl.
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well - nobody's perfect.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Where did he conduct?
I'll say.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
No, my flag steward.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
They repealed Prohibition?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
I don't mind if I do.
Where's your shell collection?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Complete washout.
Talk about sad.
Why?
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Mineral baths - now really!
Did you have a nice time?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Why?
Why wouldn't I?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Are you sure you’re okay?
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
You are taking the piss?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, hello.
Shrink, actually.
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
I slept with your sister.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Love.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
I do?
A wedding.
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
This happened to you?
What?!
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
Make out with you for free.
Yeah.
Meet Nick.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Is there any other way to take it?
That does it...
I try...
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
What do that mean?
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
He'll show up one day.
I think so...
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
What's that, son?
Yes, ma'am...?
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Montana.
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Okay.
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
What Cartman?!
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
A hunger strike? For what?
Huh?
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Uhh...
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprph!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
MOM!!!
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Yeah, so what do we say?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
What is 'fisting'?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
I'm needing lunch.
Oh God... What have I done...
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Oh yeah!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You don't care.
Don't call me dumb!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
It can't be.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Of course, of course...
My...wings...
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
You want to go back to shuttle work?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Taylor, you surprise me.
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Over and out!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
Simulated space walking.
I understand.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Barnes?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
We have room!  Let's go!
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
So I've been told.
That is one of my priorities.
Where's Taylor?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
I'm from Akron.
Find your bowler?
What do you want with old man Faz?
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, Sid.
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
It's a beautiful thing.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
The small ball.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I'm your blood.
I'm getting to like it here.
You got a better offer?
I didn't think so.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I never saw you.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
Cool!
Uh...over easy.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Junior who?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
Bowling "Center"!
Like this?
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Coming right up.
Kinda tough on the butt.
No. Not at the present.
Plan B is your dad.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
You got any broken bones?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I'll be at the bridge.
You should.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Tell your little pal to let go.
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Who identified the body?
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Two and a half days?
What was that?
What if it attacks?
Forty yards.
That's our reserve air.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What's wrong with oxygen?
What?
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Working on it now, sir.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
In a minute, sir.
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
A break for what?
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
He understands me fine.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
Resetting the sub.
I love secrets.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What do you mean -- not normal?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Beth --
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
But I don't know how --
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
You think, in the sphere --
I don't know.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
Bingo.
Parasolutrine?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
C'mon -- what?
You manifested that, Beth.
Shut up, Beth --
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
You hear that?
Beth --
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Another attack?
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
You sound defensive.
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
I don't follow you.
What noise?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
You didn't say that about the food?
The three of us.
I don't think so.
Shut up and catch.
Well, press something!
You mean forget?
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
What does Norman already know?
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The ships?
Captain who?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
What report?
Know what?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
The creature?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm not going out there.
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
Could I learn to feel it?
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
They use the Bogan Force.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
Why didn't you say so before.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
With four casualties?!
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Are you safe?
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
What an honor...
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
So who's got time to get married ?
Who ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
I'll meet you outside.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Alright, I love you.
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
Yes, ma'am !
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
How come we never got together ?
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Well, excuse me, sir...
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Teenagers !
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Uh, I don't know.
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
To join with him.
You may proceede.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Engineering...
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
This served the purpose.
A tractor beam...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Any reply from them?
Mr. Decker... ?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
I am seeking answers, Captain.
The point... 
To you, sir?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Annie...got an umbrella...?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Go you Huskies?
I need a typewritter.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
Why did you quit?
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
But, but but but...
I understand...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Surest thing you know.
Mmm.
You're still here.
I...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Better idea...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
It's for your finger.
Read the card.
Go you Huskies!
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
That's right...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
Did as of last week.
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
That's so beautiful...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
No.  Don't tell me that.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
They think it's your First Wife...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
What'll I do for fun?
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
No, you're absolutely r...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Mr. Bailey.
Who is it raped you?
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
...we had a script conference...
Yeah.
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
What?
...yes...
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I'm only trying to...
He treated me as if I were a child...
Well.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
My wife's going to have a baby.
He should be put in jail.
You bet he did.
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I treated you like a son or nephew.
Then you're finished in show business.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
You didn't see it...
It's lovely.
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
...not the Lazyboy...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
Mmm...
You think so?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
Well.  It's for you.
She is but an arriviste.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Mom?  What's wrong?
That's my girl...
No.
That's nice Ben.
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
I knew where I was all the time.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
That's Rache's song!
Half.  Of him.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Something's up wi...
You think I didn't get that?
We're not discussing your age.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Get out!
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
You WHAT?
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
...it's my problem, too.
Ironic, huh?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
You mean, after I'm dead?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Double.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Not yet.
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
I think so...What do you think?
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
Because you've changed so much.
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Does Jackie know this?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Thanks, Scoob.
Nice to have you here.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Really? How many?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
No.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Yes, I do. I love them!
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Just the same.
One in a million recover.
Uh huh.
Nigger.
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Who is this?
Great!
But...you called.
Yeah.
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
No, I don't think so...
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Prnceton.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Listen man, I don't need this shit--
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
There's the fence...
The transmission is an hour old...
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Get your men to do it!
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
Moffo!
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
I have your word, Mister President?
At his office in the Capitol.
Where is this...thing?
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
So what?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Thank you, sir.
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
To peace on earth.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Right.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
And you'd like to see that?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Call them every five miles.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.
Hang on, boys.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
But who would be chosen?
I don't know.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Was it okay?
Typical male.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Okay, whatever you want.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
And your mom.
Shut up! Aw...
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Okay.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Sure.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Tim...
Bullshit.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Great.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
No, but I heard it was great.
Hey, thanks, man.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
A reel?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
We were?
It does look good.
Thank you.
Nobody. Sooze.
Sooze wants to see him.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
You lied to me.
Yes.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Just put it down.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer Chaudry!
Man?
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Your completely missing the point.
Yes, I stand for -
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
And?
New ground?
Mm-hm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
You do.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
No, it's not...
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You're not serious.
Mine too.
You done?
I'm moving.
No, I'm going.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Whatever.
Don't do that.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Hey, Tim.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Cleo!
Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
She thinks you went to the police.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
I didn't mean to --
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
It's just impossible.
Nobody can be that busy.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
Come on, Joe.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Or teach it a better tune.
Fair enough.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
I don't care.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
There sure is.
You'll like it here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
What scene?
They've come for my car.
I need some money right now.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Come on!
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
This is the right day.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
You're a darling.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
Why do you say that?
I went for a walk.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
You made her a star?
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Thank you, Max.
They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
This is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
We can't do that.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Like turning off a light.
That makes it worse.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
I don't see why not.
How do I fight it?
I know it.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Nurse! Help !
I don't want your help.
I've got things to do.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I can't help it if men notice me.
You bet your ass.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Throw him out.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Cheap but effective.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
That's home.
I was on Earth...
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Tuesday.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Nope.  Never. 
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
I mean him.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Thirty-five.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
One.  And a half.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Columbia.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
What will it get me?
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
What she call you?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Diet soda?
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Gus?
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Storms! Floods!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
A normal person.
She'll be fine.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
In July???
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Lois, you're amazing.
Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Lois, someday --
I like worrying about you.
You do?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Does Lois know about this yet?
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
Genius!  --  Lex.
It's beautiful.
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
Where?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Australia.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Put down Lex Luthor?
It will. Starting with your own.
Free!
Stay. I will come to you.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Our other dinner guest.
It always is with Clark.
A toupee that flies?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
What?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
You are . . .
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
It was hot, yes.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Not unless you can fly.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Oh.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
No, you're going to get kissed,
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
I knew you'd hit me.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Lex is going bye-bye.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Gets you where you live, huh?
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
He'll be weightless.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Oh.
Thirty-five.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I...uh...check.
Otis...
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Ally.  That's right.
How are you?
Are you still in touch?
But you said...
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
I hope she gets better.
I understand.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
They just finished supper.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Billy, please.  The children.
How?
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
Billy, that's too early.
Your kids never cry.
Sure.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Did they give him special care?
That would complicate things.
Excuse me?
I didn't say that.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
It's like a song.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Yes.
People who will help our cause.
Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Perfect.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Yes.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
No.
Do you have this agreement with you?
Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
Yes, I understand.
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
There's talk of that.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
I doubt that it matters any more.
I only had a few hours.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Why, has he bothered you before?
Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
No.  I'm going home.
Susan!...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
I don't believe it.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
Talk to her yourself...
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
- He's got them on him.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
But what?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
I can't
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Why?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No problemo.
I'm sorry, John.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.
I know, Mom.  I know.
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Relax now, Sarah --
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And no elbows on the table!
But I promised your mother.
I guess so, sir.
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
So what is it?
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
and totally irrelevant.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Yes.
Of course.
I would like to go now, please.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
And what did he say?
Yes, that's what happened.
What?
I don't understand what you mean.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
One of your people told me.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Like this bandleader.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Can you handle it?
You're a big help.

What's it to ya?
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
That's not my mission.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
I want it to be over for you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
You're not supposed to.
The year 2027?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Surrounded by living tissue.
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Call her again.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Please, don't do that...
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
Why not?
Oh.  FIne.
Why... ?
I think not.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Come here...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Get out.
Then, what good are you?
What are you talking about... ?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Nicholas...
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
You call them...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
I redecorated.  What about you?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Yes.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
I know.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Guess!
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
You know you can.
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
Who's Watts?
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
No.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
That?  That's Hill House.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
How could you do this to people?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
I don't know what you mean.
No.  The world has missed you.
What's his first name?
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
Just had to be sure.
Anything but Japanese.
Why not?
Come over here.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
You're home, then.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
She didn't write to me, did she.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
And that's where you met Jenny.
Again?
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Really.
No, but I know what he means.
Hard to miss.
You look alike.
It's been a while.
It was the bars, then.
Weren't you on a television series?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Ashamed.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
-- Your employer?
My employer.
What line is he in.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
How do you know?
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
And that is?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
I don't know.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Yeah. Thanks.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
We've certainly missed you.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Well? How'd she do?
I don't understand.
I can get it, yeah.
No. I--tell me--
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
How's business, Dave?
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Mm.
So you paid the guy?
...Huh?
You don't have to--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
I... just knew. A husband knows.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Oh, hell. Drink?
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Jesus...
...You ever wonder about it?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Uh-huh.
He's the dead guy.
We're just closing, friend.
Sure. Can Ed come too?
It better be good.
Why not?
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Hurry up!
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
You're kidding.
Unfortunately, no.
Correct.
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
I'm not giving up.
He's right.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
How does it work?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
I don't understand.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
What was it?
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
For what?
I have to shoot.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
What's on the ClockCam?
Amnesia.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
The memory of who?
Yeah?  Outta what?
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Did something happen today?
Every time you and Marlon--
I still want to look over a couple of things.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
There's been an accident, Truman.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Well, I made it through another night.
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
When was that?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
And if it's unsuccessful?
Have you examined them?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Who sent you?
Before the bomb went off?
That's what I'm saying.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
I just did. You're buying.
I'm in the vending room.
No.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I don't know.
How was it contracted?
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
You can't quit, Scully.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
On whose orders?
Thank you.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
I'm not taking any chances.
I want to know where Scully is.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
A virus?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Lucien Baines?
I'd be there for him.
He needs to be turned over.
She said convincingly.
What happened?
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
Peter, okay?
You're sure of that?
No problem.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
You're looking well.
Now.
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Yes.
Were you at the inquest?
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I was told there were only two men there.
Why?
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
I wish I knew.
He told you, didn't he?
He liked to laugh.
How do you know?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Of course.
That's what we want to find out.
I don't know.
Where?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Bring him in.
She's right. It's none of my business.
Take him to Sacher's.
This way, miss.
Do you know his number?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
You wouldn't do anything.
Here?
Vinkel.
I have guests waiting.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Help you out?
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Here.
I don't think so.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
But he has been there, off course.
Two.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Uh-huh.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Who the fuck are you?
Fire...
I have a job.
You will.
Are they still together?
That's stupid. Why would they?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
What's it mean?
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
Why?
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Fuck that.
Do they?
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
How do you reconcile the two?
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
Think about your father. Your sister.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
A Jewish prayer.
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
Number ten.
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Just do it.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
How?
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
No.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
So what?
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
The documents are forged.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
He's training.
Fine!
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Who?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
I don't know... why?
... The way she moves.
I got fired.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
They got the new T.V.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No.  I'm just depressed.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
He isn't going to breathe.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Sure. Why not.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Mazel Tov!
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Worse.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
Resting?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
I don't know —-
What about me?
I sleep it off.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Go on -—
No. I'm quite sure.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -— eh?
No.
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
It's better you don't know.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Will you please come with me?
And that is the last time any...
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
What... What are you talking about?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...
You’re mad...
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
You bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...We’re turning in circles.
Something like that?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Don’t fall asleep with your hair wet.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
Why?
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Where is he?
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
How are you, Jane?
Good.
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
What if it is?
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
When... I’m told he came here...
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Don’t jump any red lights.
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
‘Le Mercury’. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Shut up!
He just said he had good reasons.
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Excuse me?
Uh-huh.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
It’s a good guess...
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
It would not be the same without you.
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
The English??
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Last night.
No... I want to be confessed.
Silence her!  Take her away...!
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
You did well...
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... You look wonderful...
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
The other half.
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
His face.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Yes, it's a miracle.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
That's now what I meant...
No!
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Not for long...
If you kill him, you kill me!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
What signs?
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
What for?
Are you sent by God?
Then... why are you here so often?
Him?
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
Jeanne, be patient.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Dorota.
Let's find out.
What?
Thanks.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Do they?
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
Just shut up.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
I can look after myself!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Yes, that's why I brought it.
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Why didn't you come to me?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Cow!
Dirty pig!
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Sorry, I don't remember.
A pianist.
Not yet.
Watch his hand
It will be very dramatic.
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
There is something to be said for silence
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
Yes
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
You mean in signs?
No, not words.
Everyone has to practice.
What happened?
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
It must come.
You've missed this bit.
Tomorrow.
Play a song then
What's the line on Visitation?
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
No.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
I think it's the best...
Then why ain't he dead?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Shove off, Duff.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
Who's got the contract?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
You sober?
You mean you blew it.
I'll take him anyway.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
And?
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Did he say he wouldn't?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Then why you doin' it?
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
And you were gonna pay me back?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got a system, Carver?
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
I don't know, figure something out.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
You weren't hired to miss him.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Come on, gimme a break.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Nothing.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
Then what are you hiding?
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
There!
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
I've got to see you alone!
You see how much we have to say.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
We were looking for this bird.
What's that to you?
Man to man, I'm not.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
What do you mean?
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
Nunheim!
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
--was Wynant's.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I see.
No.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
Where were you?
You've said that for weeks.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
That's my business.
I can't! I haven't got it!
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
I'm not telling anyone.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Well, don't you?
You're always teasing.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Why do you say that?
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
No.
They were kidding you.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
At breakfast.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Yeah.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Who's that?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
You talk as if I were Asta.
So am I.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
It was his body that was buried there.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Couple of months anyway.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
I don't know.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
You his wife?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
You did.
Y-yes.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
No, please, not again.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
We can't just go off and--
We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
He...he could have been watching us.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know he isn't.
We're at war.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
What are you doing?
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
OH MY GOD!
Wait.  Wait.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Roger that.
Oh, that's fun.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Get up off your ass and dig!
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
How!?
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
It's got to be going better than this..
And then what?
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
How the hell should I know?
The photos.
A headache?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
At-at-at-at-at.
What?
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
What do you see?
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
4732...?
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like food.
AH UGH.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
When?.....How?
No, I...
I don't know.
All the insides are gone!
All right...
Yes...
No thanks, Bev.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Off the scale.
Okay, let's go in.
Don't touch that.
What... ?
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
We work fast enough for you?
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
People are dying.
Alex-
Nothing so far.
Look, it's important.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Shit. We're fucked.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
I didn't. But I had to try.
I know.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
No!
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
No.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
Just call me Gaston.
Now just a minute, Major--
The tennis player?
Thank you!
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
No, thank you.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Gaston Monescu.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Ah!
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Not particularly.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Do you realize I have light eyes?
No. What is it? Tell me.
It's disgraceful!
You're hired!
How do you like my dress?
Good night.
You're conceited--
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
I <u>must</u> go.
No--thirty-five! 
Yes, madame!
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
I don't want your money!
But you're the more intelligent one.
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
So do I.
An accident?!
Not the better half.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
No, but we're making excellent time.
No you won't.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Could I speak to you in private?
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
Well, here you are.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Right.
I promise.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Baloney!
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can't.
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Now you're talkin'!
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Think again--
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
What?
So what?
Well, did you find me?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Just what the doctor ordered.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
I'm getting seasick--
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
He's all right.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
No!
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
I'll explain later--
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Nice voice.
Maybe even my destiny.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Beauty, ain't he?
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
And you must be Doc Holliday.
No...
Not exactly...
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
Ignore her?
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
Never got to wear one of those.
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
I made a promise.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
I hate Sadie.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
You wanted to talk?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Forget it, Ringo.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
I'm sorry.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!

Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Of course.
Happily.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I'll keep that in mind.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.

Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Excellent.

Yes.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
Why in the h...
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
Now how far would further out be?
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
You invited me.
Those boys never did have good luck.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
What's a toby?
Country people got so many strange ways,
It is so considerate of you.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
You can bring ONE toy...
Just one?
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
But what if we leave them behind?
What?  What is it?
Let's let Molly open one.
Mm-hmmmmm.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
No, you can't.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Don't tell me what to do!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Yes Sir!
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
What?
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
I thought he was at summer camp!
Slink!  Hang on!
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
Living with him put years on me.
Can you move over a wee bit?
It was only a mouthful!
Surely she is older?
So did I.
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
That's frustrating.
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Are you going to?
Helena --
Yes.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Yeah.
Not this time.
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Any idea how much?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You were in my way.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Sorry.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Certainly not.
No.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Do you recall the school motto?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No.
The park?
Roald Dahl.
What's wrong, Allison?
When are you going to visit him?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
you'll need one more hit.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
In that case --
It's fresh air.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
Went ballistic?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Raise shields.
But the shuttle-
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Go, Sulu.
And that is?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Why?
Damn.  Let's go.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I did not.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
The ship needs its Captain.
  
He's not?
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
I know, I met him.
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Oh. Anything else?
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Right on the money!
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Hah.
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
You're alive!
How about you?
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
I'm shocked.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Here, check these out.
Fourteen, Harry.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
The purse is still at the house.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
You know about that?
Yes sir.
Yes, sir.
Is that why you got into this business?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
No.
And you agreed?
What did you need?
Yes or no.
My husband can't know about this.
No.  But I wanted to.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Those idiots.
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Hello, Alabama.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
This is great, we got cable.
Oh, hush up.
Ya looked through it?
The oriental.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
I don't remember.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
That's a long time.
Do you get paid a lot?
Five.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Uh-huh.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
My pimp.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
What?
I just gotta get somethin'.
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
I think what you did...
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Live with what?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Yeah.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
Tell me.
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Let me handle this.
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Want an animal cracker?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
The police department?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
I can see what you mean.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Me too, Boris.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
What makes you think I would do that?
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I give up. Who are you?
Sure.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Or a supporting actor -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
He knows something's up.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No.
I need to go now.
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
What?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
I...I...We need cash, James.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
What are you talking about???
You know -- your plan.
I'm here about some monkeys.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
Maybe I do.
I won't hold my breath.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You afraid of the dark?
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
Where to?
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Harlin around?
You own this place?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I want my car.
Yeah, give me the Miller.
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
John--
Who the hell is this!?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You haven't even looked at them once.
There's someone in the house.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
What happened to your hand?
That's all right.  I got it.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Come here.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Where are you going?
To get my car.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Just drive.
Now what?
But you said we could be together.
I'm here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Isn't that illegal?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You're talking like a mad man.
I need thirteen.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
You didn't kill her?
You love her, but you hate her?
Shut up.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
You're not talking sense.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
I said come on!
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
But you was going to fight for me.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Will you shut up!
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Not as bad as it looks.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I didn't do anything.
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Senor, you need a doctor.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What do you want for free?
You know I won't be seeing you.
You expect me to believe that?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Grace, tell him.
Accident.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
I do.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
You're talking like a madman.
And what does that make you?
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
What's your name anyway?
Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
That's right on my way.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You sure you can manage?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
What happens when you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Did you like it; me watching you?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Try me.
Yeah.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
How much?
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
No baby, you got it wrong.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Jesus.
It's finished. I won.
Was it serious?
We've already begun.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
No Jeremy.
I see.
You're lying.
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
In the passenger car?
How did you get together?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
But what they done, they...
You told them cowboys you had it.
We was... lyin'.
You ain't dead.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
I could run off them whores.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
Letters?
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
But... if he doesn't miss?
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
What'd Ned say?
Then... what?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Oh.
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
Shut up, Kid.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You ain't shot.
Huh?
Eleven.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Well, she...
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
You're marking us, Bill.
He's dead, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
That was your idea, I wanted to...
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
I don't get it.
Goddamnit.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Alright.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
Three million?
Not if we do it my way.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
Just do what I tell you.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
What?
I know he was good.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Kobayashi.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
I knew him. He would never -
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
... tell me about this case.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Gruber...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
What does it mean?
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Tell us.
No.
It's a crime.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
Hold on a second.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
Well...
...I made a reservation at...
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Yes.  I wrote it.
And you wrote that...
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Thank you for seeing me.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
The TV didn't work.
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
What...?
Is there going to be a later...?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
I'm going to help her.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I'm swell.
You use their witness.
The 'History'...?
It's locked.
Mrs...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I want you.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Who you are --
Mmm.
I'll take care of you.
Honest?
Ah, no!
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
How does it work?
Oh, yeah. There.
To complete my cure.
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
Yes!
At...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
Some people prefer it.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
No.
Have you been here before?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
Home?
...somewhere in the light.
Why? What's happened?
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Where?
To the church, I must go there.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
I won't lose you.
How do you know? Personal experience?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It's where you belong.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
My... the acrophobia.
How?
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Just wander.
Oh... this and that.
Naturally.
Oh?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Can we have it by tonight?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
Sorry Fish.
I have plenty of friends.
What are you talking about?
There's more.
I'm calling the police.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
I am not flexible on this.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
I don't give a damn.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
Don't ever stare him down.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
I don't think so.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Well, oh...
Lois please.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Who?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
I'm not talking to you?
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
True.
You will not screw this up.
We're not goosed.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
I think I forgot the tent.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I wouldn't know.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Who else?
Why? What's his problem?
You will not be common!!!
Not padded ones.
Maybe.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Not yet.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
Hey. It's me.
Call the police.
It's too late.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
But...
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
It means she's insecure.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
You're not breathing right?
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
Buzzing?
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
My God...
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
Okay great. What will that be?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
That's our plan.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
It's a present from my parents.
Was that difficult to get?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Go away! Leave me alone.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
You're happy, aren't you!
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
You cannot leave ...
This louse is looking for trouble.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Have I slept long?
Today, a good girl.
No, I don't want to.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
But only you will know he's not human.
If you can catch him.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
He hears...everything.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
John died.
That's not true, Parker.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Go to hell.
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
This is my area of expertise.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
More or less.
I couldn't tell you.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
My...secret.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re—Election Rally...
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
It's the White House.

We're locked into Albania.
Who're you working for?
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I have a question for you.
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
What do you think would hold it off?
The... 
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
...that's what it is.
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...

Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
...if I had your looks, better.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Coulda been a contender.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
What if he asks where I got the money?
I don't know anything!
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Okay.
Yeah, right...
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?

So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Jackson, Steinem...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Break it.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Why?
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
It's over you, Gordon.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Come on.
Right.
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
Of course you will.
Why?
So much.
Then we both are.
How do you know it's a she?
No.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
Who's that?
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
You're the flower lady.
Who?  Your husband?
I've never even met you.
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
We know each other.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
You got it.
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Shhh.
Jody, wait.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
I was down in Adamant...
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
How is it?
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
Did you call the police?
You're kidding.
Wow.
You didn't?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
What's going on, Claire?
Shhhh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
...Don't get all...
Five minutes?
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Sweetheart--
Then where is she?
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
STOP IT!
It's too rough.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Look for antiques...
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Two what...?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Come.  There is a lot to read
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Eighty million doll --- ?
There are things you will not tell him.
Like this...?
I LOVE him!
But have I...?  Ever...?!
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
I know.    you are my son -
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Mad. for each other.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Michael!
What were you talking about...?
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Stop it!
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Just don't fall off any ladders.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
CHIC MAGAZINE?
All the time?
No - not all the time - I mean
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
What's with all the locks - and hammering
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
I'm a dentist
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
Why should I?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Out - I may be some time
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Yes - I suppose so...
What was I supposed to do?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I'm your landlady
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
Yes, come on in...
Yes - of course.
You and your pep talks.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Were you always this sick?
That's crazy talk.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Not ever. Never.
Yeah, whatever.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Yeah?
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
You're way ahead of me again?
Well, why should I?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Just say it, Dad.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
It's not up to me.
You're a peach.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
Whatever.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I'm trembling with excitement.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
That's hard to believe.
You're quick. I like that.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Very ambitious. I like that.
You better.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
But how would we pay our bills?
You called the cops on us?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
I'd like that.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
You could say that.
Just check out the car.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I wanna go home now.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Sam!  Hi!
No you don't.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
In back of the garage.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Yes.
God, I've been calling you.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
I just want my life back...
That's right.
Will they?
Shut up.
Yes.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
We?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Can't.  Got a passenger.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
What about the explosive?
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Uh... how long ago was this?
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Thank you.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
I adjusted it.
What?  President Grant is...!
But it only has six legs.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I don't like to lose, either.
Private train?
My friend?
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Dr. Loveless?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
You managed alright.
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
You are very important, Willow.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Absolutely!
Elora Danan!
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
She's a bird, Willow.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Absolutely not.
No!
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
Shhhhh!
He never misses.
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Madmartigan.
Here.  Hold her.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Good, you start tomorrow.
Just do it!
Okay, Mr. Book.
Oh, he's good.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
It won't happen again.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You'd lie to protect him.
He's got my number.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
His name is John Book.
I know.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
I don't think she knows.
Lean on him.
They don't have any shit.
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
To see?
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Oh --
This?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Oh -- yes.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Did you say something?
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
Well, you're perfect now.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Yes...!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh --
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Who at?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
You don't neither --
Ohhhhhh!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Hurry -- hurry --
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Who did you get it from?
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
...you should rest.
I don’t want to be safe!
What are you talking about?
You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
You, of course. I need some information.
And the payoff on the tables?
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Please.
Someone will come.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Because --
I won't do that.
Jon -- what??
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
You're sure?
Old?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
-- What?
I don't know their real names.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
We're not after car thieves here.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Who says you're the good guys?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
What weapons do you have?
You do everything Yorgi says?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
Go to hell!
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Aren't you afraid?
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Let me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
I can see that. Why?
Why you dogging me up?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
... until he found tungsten.
Its core?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
Were you now?
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
Is it enough?
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
