So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
The "real you".
She okay?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Hi, Joey.
Why?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
So they tell me...
How many people were in your old school?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Why not?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
He's pretty!
What's the worst?
Yeah
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
How'd you do it?
William would never have gone to a state school.
You didn't
Who?
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Are you following me?
Okay?
This is so patronizing.
Why 're you doing this?
Why?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Good call.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Acting the way we do.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
What plan?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
How far from here?
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
He understands.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
How long?
I have to disagree.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Where can I meet this man?
Six days ago, yes.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You bloody...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
But it's...
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
You considered becoming a prostitute?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
In the kitchen.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Oh.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
I'm gonna propose.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
You goin' to the escort service?
Two heads.
You thirsty?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
So am I.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
So...who's Nicky?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Okay, til tonight.
See you later.  Good luck.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Okay.  You ready?
And what do you do with the bones?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where's Czech girl?
How long are you planning to stay?
Who is he?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
We spent it!
Ha. Ha.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
You've got a call.
Viewer discretion advised!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Yes...he's my friend.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
She's in the bathroom.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
I want to drive awhile.
Hello, again.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
How about it?
You lying son of a bitch...
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Now, where we goin', convict?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Just tell me about the money.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
What?
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
You stay with me...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Yeah, I see her.
Hey, there she is...
You okay?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
What the bell happened?
Billy Bear...
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
So do you...been a long day.
Bullshit red tape.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Hi, it's me...
Hiya, kid.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Where is he?
Who the hell are you?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hard man to live with.
Shut up.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Give it back.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I was talking to the cat.
The Fifth Element...
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Other than that... You all right?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Yeah, very big, a giant.
Why not?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Here we go again...
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
It's up to you now, Angel!
...Like love...
The cash man!
Been here long?
Actually only one cell survived..
Talk English Doc.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
You couldn't?
Mrs. Christian.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Dino...
And they are?
Machine's in?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
I'm not so sure about this.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
I'm gonna kill you.
I don't know...
Do it.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Big date tonight?
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Child pornography.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Who is he?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's this?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
It won't work like that.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Nothing remotely like this.
I hope it's nothing serious.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
No.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No... no... no...
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
I don't get it.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
I'm sorry honey, but...
Something wrong with the stairs?
I gotta get out of here.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Alice...
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I thought about that.
Poor woman...
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Unidentified Flying Objects.
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
So?
We're stuck tight!
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Yes, Griff?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Under <u>water</u>?
Who with?
What do you think?
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Swell!
He did!
Why?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
Twombley involved?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
You see it?
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Really.
Sun's gettin high.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Break stuff?
I guess they're stupid.
What are you talking about?
It's fun.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
How about a Big Mac?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
I'm not saying that.
Huh?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Want to buy?
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Said what?
I'm sorry.
Call me.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
What way?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
When did she die?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Rolfe.
Just do it.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Love! I'm made of love!
Yeah.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
What happened?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
It's cut.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Nine.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Tower, here.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
A dubious distinction, no?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
You're pointing a gun at me.
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
That was war.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
You know what?
What are you doing?
Did they say anything about my family?
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Sir?
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, we're taking off!
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Not now, Elaine.
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Sure.
I don't want to live anymore.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
You folks need any help?
All right, it's a matter of death.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Striker.
Do you want to talk about it.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Yes?
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Hi!
I'm Randy.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Excuse me, Sister?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Lay off, asshole.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Let's talk Hubley.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Nothing.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
But I-- .
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
This is mole.  It's good.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Shit!
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Yeah.
What?
Get outta there!
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
How long until it blows?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
That the atmosphere processor?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Range twenty meters.
Did you ever have a baby?
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Look, I told you...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Yes.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
What did you think of the music?
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Hardly.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Now?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Yes.
Yes!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
What?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I'm not telling you.
Excellency!
Frau Mozart?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
These are originals?
Leave him alone!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
Really?
Who was your teacher?
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
Do you like this, Salieri?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
And German?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Don't you have a maid?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
What?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Did you like it, then?
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
What exactly are you working on?
How fortunate.
Did my work please you?
You mean she's not coming back?
Shall I answer it?
Would you? Actually, you could.
Of course.
Oh, yes.
Strange!
We ended in F Major?
That's wonderful!
And that's it. Do you have it?
Yes.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Herr Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Leave me alone.
I can't say I do. What is it?
You cannot say that!
What?
But not his body.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Oh my son, my poor son!
Yes.
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
How did he look?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Dr. Hirsch?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
How is that?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
That's not really a very proper question.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
I've left those pills for you.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Don't you remember?
He all right?
Chart says he's from New York.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Are you cold?
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Ask them what the candles are for.
Go on, ask them.
I have no idea.
I heard that.
Pecos Bill.
It's in front of us.
Where are we going?
Thanks a lot.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're not real.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
What do you think?
Hi, Jack.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
No, thank you, Doctor.
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
What's that?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Remember the Alamo?
Where's Matt?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
He has?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
What about?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Fifty thousand dollars!
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
The theatre?
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Yes?
Yes?
Yes?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Why, I don't know.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
With what?
The ten dollars.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Are you sure?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
We got a problem here, brother?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
He's not bad at it.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
You shut up now, boy.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Yep.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
On account of we're robbing it.
What is it?
Mm-hmm.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
What do you think?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're doing this for Ma.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Jim was old enough...
Yeah.
Did you kill Yankees?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
And what's this right girl like?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
Let me see that.
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
You okay, Jesse?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
So you can't tell me anything?
I can't believe this.
Can you put men at all four?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Yes?
Uh huh.
Dorsia's nice.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
This is Dorsia?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Take it off.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Really?
Do...what.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
We need to talk.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
How did you guess?
What exactly do you mean?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
SHUT UP!
What's that, a gram?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Don't tell him you're here.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Who do you ask?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
I'm so hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
It's...it's...all right.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
What?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
That's gotta kill him, right?
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Well -- you sent for me.
It scales, don't you think?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Let's go.
Wait... He knows.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Did I say something?
Why's that?
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
What about "60 Minutes."
How close are you?
Thank God.
Why?!
What does that mean?
She's a programmer?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
To my health.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Basil.
Hello, Exposition.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
My God, Austin, what have you done?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Well, you can't always get what you want.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
A Chigro?
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I can't. You're drunk.
No, did you use a condom?
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Indeed.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Oh my God, he's back.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Dr. Evil?
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
An evil petting zoo?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
There are limits?
Knight ...
... death ...
Love...
Secret ...
How long have I been here?
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Then who wins?
The Institute ... the funding ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
You killed my husband.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
What are my choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
But why? What's the point?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
You mean my other self ...
Is that what you think?
Because you always obey orders ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
You lied.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Weather's turning nasty.
Insane ... ?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Where?
No, please! I beg you ...
You're better than I expected.
You said ... one shot.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Rick, I want to talk to you.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
But how can I do that?
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Huh? Wha...
I can't trust you!
Let go of me!
Why is Cole here?
A real turd.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Is that all the coke in the place?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
No, Brett, I...
Under the table!
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
I like what you've done with the place.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Hey! You don't know me --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Ready?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I know.
-- What were they doing there?
You're back.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
When I was twenty.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Okay.
Brian. What's wrong?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
What?
But he killed these guys.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
What the hell are you doing here?
So what do you want me to do?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Do you have to do that?
Firehouse.
Fixing my roof.
He's got piano lessons.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
I treated you better.
What's wrong?
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Who's this?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Got a cause?
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
All right. What are you gonna do?
Are you sure?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
YEAH!
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
Yeah, him.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
You might be right.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Please, have a seat.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
But the line has to be drawn.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
How did you know?
Do you know how you will use him?
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
We both lied to him.
I thought it was appropiate.
Hi, Mona.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
It looks delicious.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Yes he did.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
You know how your Daddy is.
I never had a really real pair before.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
I fell out of my bed last night.
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Aw, c'mon.
Good morning.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
And his baggage?
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your honor must lower his voice.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
That is a trifle strong.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
How so?
Agreed.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Yeah, if you've slept.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Who?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
He's lying.
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
So you killed him?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Oh, come on --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
What happened to "degrees"?
Why did he come back for you?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Where are they!
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Tom, where are you going --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
That is the most unprofessional --
Baseball?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
Something wrong?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
That bugs you too?
That's a fantastic idea --
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
We need to talk --
This isn't the time --
That's not true.
West?
Your phone number?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
We should tell him we're not going.
Who, Levi --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
You want Kendall, don't you?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
You won't find a better place!
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
How long have you known my father?
Eighteen.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
That's terrible.
No, I understand.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
I can.
What did she say?
Okay.
Son?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Let's get out of here.
It's unbelievable.
Wait! I need those!
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
What happened?
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Yes.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
What for?
No I don't.
It's enough isn't it?
What do you mean?
What's this?
You can see why it's sensitive?
Hello.
I need to know who you are first please.
And...
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
We better watch him. He's crazy.
No.
Uh. Do you like England?
Oh nothing.
I understand. I'm so sorry
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
Just leave her alone.
Is that everything?
What's wrong?
It's makes it easier. Okay.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
In the world.
What?
What?
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
No.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I don't have nothing.
No.
Have you had any before?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I'm trying to quit.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know.
What was her name?
You know you can come under the blanket.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Is the flight full?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
This was very sweet of you.
I bet you have loyal customers.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Hi.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
You some kind'a pervert?
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Itches.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I don't fuckin' cook.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
Still makin' jokes?
Could you do somethin' for me?
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
Sorry.
Now, hold up.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Keep the change on that.
Why she got a chain on her?
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You a preacher?
What's on your mind?
Rae...
Rae don't do this now...
Hey.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Yeah?
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Nick... You up?
Cool?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Nick...
Nick!
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
No...
How many men?
Joyce?
A wife.  She left.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
I don't remember saying yes.
What if I chant?
Might be different in New York.
She's such a long way home for you.
One guy do all the damage?
Why?
Why me?
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
You want him dead too.
You certainly have a nice place here.
If he won't cooperate?
Where?
I want more life, fucker.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
When?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I think, therefore I am.
Yeah.
Got it.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Why, yes, of course.
How do I stop one?
Okay, but...
What about a summary then.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Sorry, don't have the time.
Those cockroaches?
One more, eh?
Money?
You're going to be over the limit.
What if you change your mind?
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
In your opinion.
Do I make you nervous?
Me and my dad.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
What?
What's up?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Go ahead.
No.
She didn't know?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
Pris.
Where are your folks?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Twenty.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Yes?
Your mom was a dancer?
How do you do?
Come where?
Please excuse this interruption.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Get out of here!
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Oh, that's nice.
I haven't brushed yet.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why not go to work for me?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
It does?
Sure.
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Hey, Eve!
Do I look crazy?
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
But, Eve, I would--
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Why?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Yes, sir. It's true.
What's the capitol?
This must be very new.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Why not? He has great pants.
Why did you park way back there?
What?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
And thanks for always being happy!
My father is a genius.
Thirty-five.
I do alright.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
You got a light, honey?
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
To go up.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
Calvin?!
Why?
If he tells, it won't come true!
In the generator room again?
Yes, yes it is!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
He's smart.
What are you doing here?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
You're serious, aren't you?
Well, that's blunt!
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
What do you want to do with it?
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Frank. Come in.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Yes.
You did? A human ear?
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Who knows you have these?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
THEN WHAT?
Never before this.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
What do you want from me?
Do you like me?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Beeeee careful.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I did. Are you?
What?
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Who, Dorothy?
Don? Where is he?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Those are my breasts.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Can I use the car tonight?
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I've gotta go in.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
OK.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
He got a little jealous.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Jeffrey!!
You worry about me really?
Really?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
Just for him?
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
There's ways around that.
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Oh, Jesus.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Nine bodies.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Who did you kill?
Give the guy a shot.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Hello?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
You feel?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Continue the joke.
What color hair does he have?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Did you see that?
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That sets it off.
Loop around real fast.
Dignan, calm down.
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Holy shit.
Inez, this is --
He needs to hire an attorney.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Don't panic, Anthony.
Sixteen dollars.
I had to give some to Inez.
She needed it.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What time did he say to be here?
Shit, Dignan.
Yeah. As a girl.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
What?
What are you talking about?
He did?
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
What do you mean?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Where?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
That's a sharp jacket.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Why'd you want to help us?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Are you serious?
I'm not playing any more golf.
You think I'm improving?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
What are you doing?
No.
The front stairs.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
That never would of --
Yes. I did.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I'm going to take a look at this.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Did we get it?
How much is there?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Is he chasing us?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
What do you mean get back?
This could be a trap.
I know it's not.
Just get in the car, Bob.
You said 48 hours!
That's OK.
I couldn't hear anything.
Is he breathing?
Do they let you --
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
How you doing, Bob?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Well, I think --
Where?
You like Chicanos?
Got a little lucky.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Don't know.
Sit down.
No good options left?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Yes...
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You know I'm not.
Is this really happening?
I emptied it.
Front. Use your teeth.
I don't know who that is.
No. There's nothing new.
Sleep. Sleep now.
-- where's left to go? --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
I know it's a dream.
Why are you here, then?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
Who?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
How long have you worked for the agency?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
Do we know what this says?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace's followers.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
A common thief.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I've missed you.
I'm dreaming.
Peace is made is such ways.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
We can't stop!
They've tricked us.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
But you must have something to go on?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Darn it!
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Sure...
You're. Acting. Like your father.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Different? How?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
What time is it?
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
It didn't feel like a dream.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
What?
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Lenny? Come on!
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
How long have you been married?
Does he know that?
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And you want to know --
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Good.
I see.
Er, my check, please.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Practically no one.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
I will.
A franc for your thoughts.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Yes.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Goodnight.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
How do you do?
Good evening.
My office.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
Had a close one, eh?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
May we proceed with the business?
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
You will give us the names?
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
For the time being.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
I was misinformed.
Yeah? What's his name?
Manages what?
Oh, how do you do?
Huh?
I have. Sit down over there.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Uh huh.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Are my eyes really brown?
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Yeah, boss?
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Save some for tomorrow.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
You've had today's water.
Take it, damn it.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Get water!
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
To tell you the truth -- you did.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
You don't seem too happy about it.
He's your cute thing.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
This isn't working out.
"We're" not over-reacting.
There isn't any us.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
Is that Jango?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
What will you do?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Need some help?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
I beat the odds!
I braided them.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I mean your parents.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
People watched the movies in their cars?
But you looked as if you liked it.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Nobody special enough, Curly.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
She looks after other people's children.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Liberator...
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
It looks like scurvy.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Nobody's named this one yet.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I'm happy I amuse you.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I'm not in trouble.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Do you know him?
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Why was he missing for twenty days?
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
She took off in the night!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
But there were other factors.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Guess so.
Fuck that. We're going too.
When?
She up for this?
You'll be there?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Oh Jesus!
What -- What do we do?
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
Why?
You're just going to have to trust me.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
It's what I do. It's my job.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Jesus... Take it easy.
No, I want my cut!
Stop waving that thing around.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
What do we do? We change the scam?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
My fucking heart bleeds.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Aces, Suits.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Then who's the Banker?
I can handle it.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
High five.
My car's in the garage.
I'll take you up on that.
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
You called the casino a cesspit.
What?!
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
How's that football story corning along?
I had training. In the Republic.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
How did it go?
Marion, stop this.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Why did you take the money?
No.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
So how are you doing, dad?
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
How did you hurt your hand?
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
But if it does.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
Wait a minute...
Detective Inspector Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
You've been avoiding me.
Have I?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
Where did you go to school?
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
We do. 
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Bruised.
The key!
The key, goddamit, the key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Check at six minutes.
Do you remember the detonation time?
The only thing which exists is myself.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
To explode, of course.
Hmmm...
Wha?
-- open circuit breakers --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
What happened, Doolittle?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Sir?
Yeah.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
What the hell are you doing?
You mean until you showed up?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
Lemme put some clothes on.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
No...
You're a thief?
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Sorry about your window.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
I won't be staying.
How do I know you didn't?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
The other ones?
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Know where I can find her?
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
How's this about me?
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Make the call.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
True, but--
Huh?
No, I mean... you love your son?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
No problem.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Damn straight we are.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
What the fuck!
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Could be.
It's my Bullworker.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
But, mom!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
It's gone.
Good morning...
Dr. Monnitoff?
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
You'll know soon enough.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
People aren't that simple.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
So how was school today?
Know what?
Where it came from?
Who's been giving you weird looks?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
I met a girl.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
Can anyone else see him?
A sign from whom?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Why would I tell Mom?
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Kitty...
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
You're what?!
What is wrong with you?
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Yah?
Amber...
Oh shit!
Mom!
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Shut it up, Loretta.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Okay?
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
What?
The bitch.
And the year before that?
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Half watch dog?
Yankee Poodle.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Anything else? 
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
You upstart!
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
What'll I do with this card?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
But -
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Uncle, you can't do this!
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Yes please, two.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
What do you mean?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
John loves the house.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Like this. 
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He fell.  He falls.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
I want my man back.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
I want him back!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
I don't understand.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
You alright?
Yes.
Yes.
The main spire.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Yes, very soon.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes. John wants it.
Are you the proprietor?
Pardon me?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
What's the matter?
Yes.
We mustn't let him land!
Halfdan the Black.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
We blew the Horn Resounding.
What do you see, Erik?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
A lot of people like our singing.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
I'll tell you what...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He wants to kill US!
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Oh, get it over with.
Scream.
Ah.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
It's Halfdan the Black!
What's it all about?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Now stop it!
I think we should go...
Wait, Erik!
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Your lord.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Who's that?
Can't make enough swords!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
I should have got rid of you long ago!
I must only let the red rage...
Well... I'm game.
Yes, Mum.
You rat.
Oh, Tangerine.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Okay.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Take care.
What do you want to hear?
You just say. I'm not really --
Well, I should probably get going.
Oh, yeah.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Okay.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
I'm right here.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Happy Birthday.
This is our first "date" date.
We did talk about Naomi.
Come up and see me... now.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
I wish we did. You married?
Male or female?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Says you were a bully...
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Hi.
I just got in.
That's me.
I might be making a mistake.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Clementine.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
You have to stop this!
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
What do you want, Stan?
Nothing.
Okay, we're back in.
We can't do this.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
I tried that already.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
What was that?
Clockworks.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
You don't?
Tell me about it.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
A born freak can only go uphill.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
Coop, where are you...
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Trauma.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
What's happening...?
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
What, Justin, what shows you?
How do you know all this?
...I don't want to die...!
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
That is not acceptable --
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
It's complicated...
What about my ship?
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
I told you... She won't let you leave...
It is now.  We're locked in.
Skipper...
No, no, we just got her back together...
How much oh-two do we have?
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Miller...
Go ahead.
Blow it up?
I'll do it --
Weir.
He's been past Mars?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
It's cold.
What is it?
What are you doing?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
How'd you know it was me?
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Where is Reed?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
He's made a few changes.
Are you alright?
What the --!
We had a tough year.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
This is wrong in so many ways.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Back it down, Johnny!
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Yes, thanks.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Of course. Of course.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
But I'm not done with the machine --
What's going on?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Please don't make this personal --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Reed's gonna fix me up --
How much did they cost?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Hi, Brad.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Why?
You are a virgin!
Does Mom know you have company?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Jeff you have company!
Well...
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
It's definitely your mama.
I would. Yeah.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
Damone, are you there?
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
He is.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
How long does Doug take?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I don't know.
What's April 16th?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Really?
Anything to drink?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Las Vegas.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Hell, no!
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Jesus creeping shit!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
What tape?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Lucy.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Spare me.
Stop!
Yeah.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
And that's how I ended up here.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
Why don't you go check it out?
Yep.
We gotta be close.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Oh.
What is this?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Two.
Open?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Move slow and move quiet.
Hurry!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Hold it!
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Oh. I mean, good.
Okay, but come here first.
An actress.
Right now we have to be practical.
You learn your lines?
Who?
Without me.
Showdown.
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Were you an alcoholic?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I know.
...So what do you think?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
I wouldn't miss it.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Quietly.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Jesus.
The hell you will, Harry York.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I'll bet.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Where to?
How did I look?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Did you expect him to look you up?
I live here.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Then why did you bring them?
Say you promise.
Haven't you heard what I said?
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
You're not going anywhere!
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
No!
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
She's beautiful.
He always was opinionated.
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor!
Do you really think I'm mad?
Can you think of a better reason?
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
You can't. Death is God's will!
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Is that your diagnosis?
You've been going round-the-clock?
For what?
What happened up there?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Professor Waldman.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
I don't hear it anymore.
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
Sure.
You saved my life.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
Jack?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Looks like a storm.
Are you wet?
How many with you?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
You like the car?
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Why did they block the door again?
Jacob.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Not a chance.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
He backed down.
What did you call me?
In the Winnebago.
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
No!
What's going on?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What's in Mexico?
What did I say?
Yeah, we got a bible.
You're gonna let us go?
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
I wasn't scratching!
Whiskey!
You can't come in here.
Best in Mexico.
Gotcha!
Feels good.
How do you know?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
What?
Yes.
Richard!
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
You okay?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
What do you mean?
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Got it.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
No, sir, WHAT?
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Then good night.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
White House boys want a private meeting.
Hardly the case, Senator.
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
"Coronado."
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I oughtta report you.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Me?  Why me?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
What?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
You got anybody, Wick?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
I just wonder how that happened.
I don't know.  Seems...
That's cuz I'm married to you.
What?
I like that image.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
My God. He's going after the nest.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
I'll take them all.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
And you think this creature is one of them?
You'd be surprised.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
What?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Not for a long time, now.
Merde!
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
Why do you need that?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Who the hell are you?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Thanks.
God, what an ass.
At ease men.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
He's a twit!
He wants to THINK!?
Shut up.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
... Yes?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes...?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
How did you come to that conclusion?
Up.
Yes?
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
I am SO SICK of being right.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
What?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Are they behind us?
That's it, It's go time.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Home.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
What's going on?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
NO NO NO.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
What?  What are you talking about?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
No, my lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Yessir.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Gag on your own invention, then.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
They help me understand why we fight.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
I rode here, on my horse.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
General Greene?
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Africa, of course.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Then why are you teaching me...?
Who says so?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
My daughter, I ask only...
You're kidding me, right?
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Who?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I have to ask you for that key.
He's around someplace.
You can talk to me.
There's Ilona.
What about her?
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
I don't believe this.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Look at me, Ray.
How'd you get in here?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
That's right.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I know what a marker is.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
But you work for the casino?
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
One of his best parts.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
You have it?
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
So you want to know.
Like this?
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
We call you a taxi.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
...That's what we finally decided.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Man, can you scream.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
And you think the movie business is any different?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You're as bad as Harry...
You okay?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
I told you not to -–
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Harry -–
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Where from?
What?
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
This's gonna hurt a little.
What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.
So we kill him?
What?
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Hard to say.
Goddamit, Dodge.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
What is it?
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the fuck -- ?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
You're late.
That's what I call a payday.
Go on.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
You're more practical than superstitious.
He needs a doctor.
Same. Any luck?
But where's the damage?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
Nope.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
How's that?
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
What now?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
You don't remember?
We're still drifting.
No, no. You got leak.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Yup.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Are you going to yell at me?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
But I can't --
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
So what do you think?
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Are you the one who left that note?
What do you mean "why"?
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hey Josh.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
I might actually get the pasta special.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
I remember every minute of that party.
Why do I always have to do it?
SHUT UP!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
Not really...
There he is...
As always.
I'll bet he never jerks off...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
It's a surprise.
Where did you get that?
No way... when?
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
He gives me a total boner!
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
What are you talking about? Who?
He came into work.
When was this?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You're late, asshole.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Oh, right...
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
What, are you a klansman or something?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Are you okay?
What, like a girdle?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Maybe she's with Josh?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
Let me see the sick.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
Pleasant journey?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
Have you ever failed?
Goddammit!
But of course yours worked.
Oh yes, I think so. 
You like him, don't you?
Why so many?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
That's where the buggy stopped.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Good luck.
Good-bye, Peter.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
That's not true.  It was 1620.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Sorry!
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
What are you doing up here?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
Command me, lord.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Who are they?
You were the one who got me in.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Is the line sinking?
Who, Ray?
I'm Ray --
Like a goat on garbage.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Eight o'clock?
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Are you all right?
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
Really!  Is it gone?
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Die in what sense?
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Has this ever happened before?
Great!  How's it going?
In a storage facility.
Why do you want to see it?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
What on earth gave you that idea?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Did you see anything?
Something was definitely here.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
What is it?
All right.  I'll try.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Sorry, Buddy!
I've got to sleep.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
I told you it's real.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
Where are you, Pete?
Boy, that was a rough one.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I should at least have you, don't you think?
If I may be so bold...
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
I've read of it.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
He killed his father and then my family...
Where are they?
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
What the hell was all that about?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Will you take me home now?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine --
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
We won't. Let's go inside.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You mean the one who --
-- really incredible --
Come in.
Is it because I'm here?
I don't understand --
Because it isn't true.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
What are you going to do now?
I don't understand.
Benjamin?
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
No.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Mr. McCleery?
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Yes sir?
Where is it?
What?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
In general.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
So?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
No.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I know that. But I'm --
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But they would! Don't you see?
May I sit down?
Did you get us a room?
What?
Do you want to get it now?
Well -- I don't know.
Well -- goodbye then --
Thank you.
Benjamin.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
This is all terribly wrong.
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you really want me to?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
About five years.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
See if you can guess.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Yes.
Well how did it happen?
What?
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Don't talk about Elaine.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
If that's how you feel --
But if it's sickening for you --
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Drive down the block.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Now it seems to me --
Then you'd better start believing me.
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
What else?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
When did you two talk this over?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
I've got to go.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
You'll never be young again.
What?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Quite a while.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
HUH?
Hello.
Yes?
Benjamin -- where are you?
I don't believe it.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Have you a minute now?
Yes.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
No.
Why?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
That.
Dictation.  You know...
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
We'll dance.
Yes -- oh!
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Why do you look at me like that?
How tired you are!
Am I quite strange to you?
What can you see?
There.
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
No -- not at all.
I've no luck.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Is that for me?
No -- letters to two-eighty.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Good heavens. What for?
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Oh, I've got to find it.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You like music?
Yes.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Am I!
I'm the stenographer.
What is this?
That's from skiing.
No.
Not too quickly.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Can you pay some attention to me?
Insolent young cub!
I had to arrange about the trip.
Oh, no.
What?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
I could not think of not accepting.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You're discharged.
Yes, I know them --
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Have I kept you waiting?
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
What do you want with her?
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
And if you do it wrong?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Want a look?
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
I certainly hope not.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
Oh, come on, Roy.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Don't mention it.
Up to you.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Let me see how you did that one.
Where's the five?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I'm a salesman.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Where?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
I went out to Delmar.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
Gun?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
The cemetery...
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Carter.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Now you're joking, right?
What?  Where is she?
I came to see you.
Then you come out here.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Are you going to leave, too?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
I have to pee.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Thanks!
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Why?  You interested?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But I've seen him!
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
God, what's wrong with him?
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
But surely Rogers isn't --
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Stay away, Sam.
It's a bitch.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
You know what gets me?
Can I have the Cadillac?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
And how were things?
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Huh.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
Me?
I know you think that.
Hello.
You've come to the right man.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Gee whiz--
You're my buddy.
As a matter of fact--
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
"The sting."
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Wow.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
Sir?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Damn.
Who was it?
No.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I'm engaged.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Say hello to your mother.
A trip, you mean?
Breakfast?
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I don't think so.
If he wants to go.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Rifle?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Blue soup?
You're begging him to kill you?
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
You've killed women?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Hello, Mother.
We'll miss you so.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
You're old--so old.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
My violin is avenged!
No!
No.
What are you going to do?
And you went home unannounced, too?
Dead!
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
That is sad.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Kid--kid--
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Thank God!
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Stay home tonight!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
What's his name?
That's why I'm crying.
What does he say to do?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
This is very good for us.
The what?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
Paul's only twelve years old.
It's a jungle out there.
That's been said before.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
You've got to fight from time to time.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
Well, I want to...
Wait?
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Yeah.
I don't know no Tod.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Sam?
Are you the star of this picture?
No.
It's your money. You talk.
You making a feature?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Something like that. How much do you make?
Half now, half later.
You don't drink?
And your wife? Where's she?
You know what I'm talking about.
How important do you think sex is?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
What makes you so sure?
Where is he?
So then, Mr. Mast...
And better?
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
The police? They know less than you do.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Where'd you hear that name?
Does she know anything about this?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
Is Marsha there?
Pretty good.
What?
Hey man.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Yeah.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Who told you about this?
Well...
Okay.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Sounds all right.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I don't know.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
You working in San Diego now?
Was he with a girl?
You are at the University, Candy?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Officer, I can explain.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Check.
Wait here.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What?
Yes.
But this is my car.
How about some ginger pie?
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Oh, my. We're too late.
We'll come back in the morning.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
No.
But I don't play anything.
Yes.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
"And this too shall pass away."
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
I have a sore throat.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Just give me a rough estimate.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
What about the draft?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
None at all?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
What would you say?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Harold!
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
It's coming.
God, that's terrible.
The box. I need the box.
What do you mean?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I've got to finish it.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
You were burned by some organic acid.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
You are a Catholic??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
What the hell was that? An ape?
Reliquary --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
I knew those men better than you did --
Yes?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Well good n-
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
What about you?
What -- ?
Yes, I --
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Got her mother's looks.
Lucky man.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Please listen to me --
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Frank --
I'm brother Frank.
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
What about Larry --
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
...somebody...
A long time.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
You're still afraid.
So you were cheated.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
You can't love him.
Maybe we should just leave --
What's the problem?
I was here this afternoon.
All right.
Why not?
Is it deep?
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...
What?
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
This isn't the bedroom.
Kirsty?
Of course. Every day.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
...maybe we should never have come back.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I guess.
Really?
No you don't.
It's late.
I've been better.
Your father told me you were working here.
Steve. Thank God you came.
What did I say?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
I wanna date a musician...
What do you mean, "what?"
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
What?
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
We're getting that anyway.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
That's what I said.
Anna Moss.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
I dunno.
Shit!
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
I think you know that.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
I suppose so.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Never?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I told you I slept with him.
Is that the last of it?
I'm sure.
That bad, eh?
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I guess I am.
You're soaking.
Hi.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
What about Ian?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I'm alright.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
So?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Are you okay?
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
I'll call you.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
I'm Vince.
Yeah.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
He was unsual.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
What will you do now?
Is this what you killed them with?
Yes.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
Yes.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Don't.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
What is it?
I'm just curious.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
Spare me the details.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Aye.
I was nearly killed.
He told me there could be only one.
What?
It is as you are.
It will take less effort as you learn.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I am not ready for this.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
What is your position?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Your father must be smart.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Spare a chair?
How are you?
What are you doing here?
He found us even there.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Tradition.
This your present address?
What were _you_ looking for?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Hello, Bensinger.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Hildy!
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
What do you want?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Done what?
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
No!
He's in the insurance business.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Afraid? I should say not!
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Where do you think you're going?
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Flip a coin.
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Sure.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
You grey-haired old Judas!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
I'm busy, Duffy.
What?
Let's see the money.
Me, too.
I call. What you got?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
So have we!
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
What went off?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
What is it?
No -- don't out me off.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Five hundred dollars.
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Okay.  Forget it. 
Come on with that money!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What do you want?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
They wouldn't take it.
A very fine-looking women.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
What's he want?
The door was locked.
I never was.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
I did see them. I did.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
It's like telling fibs.
What's that?
Who pays for them?
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
They might be.
Why not?
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
Has Sue got it right?
What did he say?
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
You're having me on, Molly.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
Which way?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
He left!
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Really fucking awesome.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Fine. I'll go straight.
I gotta open the gate.
Fascinating.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Goddamn.
Tickets for what?
Ugh, what's that smell?
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Yeah, no mercy here.
Not yet.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Huh?
What do they call you, sweety?
Firefly.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I don't know. I only saw one.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Tell it to my daughter.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
I always favored the Hulk.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Say my name.
Gabrielle.
Oui, doctor, oui.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Not at all.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Hmmmph.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Nice night.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
Boy, this is good!
You do?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Oh, and the sun block?
Fifteen.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
That's very funny.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
All right.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Extra dessert?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
That's right, Miss Packard.
Will you take a check, Bert?
I'm buyin'.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
That's your problem.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Why?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Hi. How's business?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
They're fine.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
You name it, we shoot it.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Well... well, now.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
Would you like to come out tonight?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
What?
Can I sit down?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Around.
Do you always ask so many questions?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Fifth of scotch?
Why?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Mm hmm.
You got it all in your head?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Does it bother you? What he said?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
Leave now.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
He went off someplace.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Is that a fact?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Yeah. That's right, too.
Your shot.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
You lived like this once.
Do you still want me to stay?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
I surrender --
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Virginia...?
Please.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Your father asked you a question.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Spunky. He told you about that?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
That signal. It's a countdown.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
What the hell is that?
College nickname.
I'm making a mess.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You know me...
Your son.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
But I gave you some this morning.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
They let you out?
How' he doing?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Mr. President?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
May we go home now, please?
Yes. Now we know.
Look what you did!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Schneider?
Are you expected?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
You could be more right than you know.
I said go around!
This one. I think he's in here.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Right.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
Dad!
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
After you, Junior.
Get that camel out of the way!
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Interested in local curios?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
That was a misunderstanding.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
What's that?
Step on it, Short Round!
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Just one arm!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
It's starting to let go!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
What about the future?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
What?
Yes.
No... they won't kill me.
Anymore ideas...?
Don't do that.
Arrrgh!
Yes?
Your name is Al...
I just got here.
What street?
I know...it sounds insane.
Kill myself.
Yeah.
Oh...Gooood!
Find You?
Corridor A.
Who did?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Gone where?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
You'll be me.
Now what?
The beach?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
I don't want to eat it.
What was?
What do I do?
Touch her.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Which one?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
You got any books in there?
Some agent you are.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
I told you, I have a feeling...
I can't...
Are you alright?
Do something.
Where've you been?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
You're a lucky man.
What are you doing?
Not that truth!
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Who is your friend?
We met on the beach.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
When you do...
Who...are you?
Don't you want to get out?
Not you. Them.
Al?
Sue who?
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Now you know what I know.
Nothing.
What do you do about what?
Blake?
Where?
I waited for you.
You are.
And how'm I doing?
What did you tell them?
I'm leaving too.
This business is over.
You know where he went?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
How do you know you can trust me?
Oh sure.
Where we going?
What?
You've  been there?
Are you alright?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
He can't help us.
It was you.
A drink...
Wait.
It is?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hi, Daddy.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Mom.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
P.J.'s.
Get me Wigand.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Do you want more rice?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
What caliber is my gun?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
No, no, we're fine...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Uh, what are those boxes?
...taping?  What are you taping?
"60 Minutes"?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
What's wrong?
...you fucked me!
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Yeah.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
No shit.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Lowell!
Yeah.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Did work.
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Yeah, great.
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You greased the rails!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Where are you, anyway?
What's happening?!
He doesn't seem to be listening...
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
A delivery device for nicotine.
"I would bet on it."
Object to the form of the question!
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
That's why we hire scientists...
They hate each other --
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Is that... one person?
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Grounds?
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
We did not.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
It's your move, Miles.
You just haven't met the right person.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
No.
Oh Miles!
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Please! Leave the house.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Miles.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
She did a Harriman.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
My client has ruled that out.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
What's Kirshner?
And she has...?
Video.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Stunt?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Is that his name?
Oh, no—no.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
No.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
I beg your pardon!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
What happened?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I found it on the seat.
What are you talking about?
You must have me confused with—
I never thought of that.
Here, boy!
Darn clever, these Armenians.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Outside!
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Why, haven't you—?
You're crazy.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
What are you thinking about?
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
Amazing.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
What'd you give him for the car?
What about money?
Not interested. 
Whatever you say, darling.
Husband?
Yes—if he is your husband.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Yeah!
Up yonder. See the lights?
Mr. Gordon—
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
See that. They're gone!
Not a minute!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Yeah. Come on—come on!
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
It leads farther than that.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
And then Sunday?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
There were admirals.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
...you heard echoes.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
A Perry Russo?
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
Please answer the question.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Get a hold of yourself.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
You know who the mayor was?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Are they?  Why would they?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Germany.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Can I help you?
Who?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Uh-huh.
Course you didn't.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
You got a good lawyer?
Great, you're here.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Can I have a word with you?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I'm not a loser.
What's in it?
But now you're telling us now you do.
Fine.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Cash poor?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
If you're having some.
'76?
How'd you find that out?
It's different with men.
Bigger?
Well, hello.
And Annette's it for you?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
In the bag underneath.
In a dress.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Who's side are you on?
He say we like the same thing as married.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
You talk to him?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
If it'll make you happy.
Uh-uh.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
You already knew that?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
What the hell you doin'?
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Didja tell 'em anything else?
Who?
So we need two people, two women.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Drink?
Two months shy of four years.
With Ordell?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Is it dead?
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
And your point is?
This one.
That's good money.
Then what?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Uh-huh.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Came outta where?
Where you shot her.
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Gonna have to put up cash.
Did the police contact you?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Beaumont worked for you.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
You know who this is?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
I know where it is.
Yeah.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Just to see you. That's all.
Grass never did that to me.
It's hard to explain.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Daddy, what was that noise?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
No. Not really ...
I saw Sarah the other day.
You should go back to her.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I don't know what to say.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
What's your name?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
What was that?
Go to sleep.
Jake, is that you?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Did you look around the headboard?
I don't let anybody call me that.
Yeah, but for what?
Lemme see.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
What?
Not to me.
Why do you bring her up?
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
He did? When?
Why didn't you call me?
What? What do you mean?
It's just me.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Please.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Oh?  Where you going?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Where are they?
Sit down!
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Long time ago.
So why tell me now?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
No. I couldn't.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
We're doing everything we can.
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
That black car?
I don't know.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
His mother?
Minimal.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Well?
Kaboom.
You lost the charge?
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Kay-em 14.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
I didn't say I was good at it.
Ow!
Who are you apologizing to?
Kay-em you okay?
I missed you too.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Azrael can you repeat that?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
What have you done?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
What?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
I never saw one that big.
Did you get him in the head?
Right.
Don't forget these.
Michael! Come inside!
You going to be all right?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
How can you tell?
Chum?
What happened?
Wait a minute! I need you.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Some friends and me took a house.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Would you like something? Some coffee?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Well... is everything all right?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
I'll drink to your leg.
Thanks for the message.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear it's yours?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
No... I guess not.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
What do you play?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Hey, I like this.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Consider it your musical education.
You do?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Oh my God...
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Your name, please?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
You're pregnant?
Who is the kid?
What?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Excuse me?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
You mean like couples?
Or...
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
What do you make with that?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
You guys are playing music?
Juno, what's the matter?
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Adele for god sake please lis...
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
Hold still.
Do what?
What's Early been in jail for?
...Anything else?
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Geez, they look kinda weird.
What the hell is this stuff?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
That bad?
Yeah?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
What are you going to do?
What about you?
Any word from that gallery?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
...Need a hand with those bags?
You were plenty hot.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Yes. Altogether.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
It's no big deal, right?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Why I do what?
So.
Right.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Casper, where's Telly.
Yeah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Right now?
Uh huh.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
What is it?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
One.
What?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
You still mad at him?
Did you bleed?
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Yep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Then what's he talking about?
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
No shit!
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
A few people.
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Peter.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
Hello?
Not really.
Why her?
I'm just trying to play the game.
How?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
What's this?
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
No problem.  We're in.
What is it?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Why did he what?
He was watching you.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Has he gotten through to any?
What is it, dad?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
Well?
Anything else?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Peter...
Whatever's on your mind.
What do you see here?
How come you don't stay with them?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It is.
They couldn't break the riddle.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
She could be dead after the game.
You have to win every point, don't you?
Relax.
Doesn't that scare you?
I'm sorry.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
You've got to face the things you feel.
Nothing.
Peter...
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
You will go alone.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
Does the Queen live?
Turold's son was to marry her.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
Never.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
From here, I must go alone.
Do not let the waters touch you.
You too are lonely.
Let me comfort you.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
You will follow me.
And where do you lead, boy?
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Go. I command you.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
A small house.
I'd wish for a puppy.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Put me down, you lout!
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
They'll trample him to death!
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A fine match.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
I was beautiful then.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...I don't know.
...Yes?
Huh? That's smart!
...And how much is it?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
...Who sent you?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Yes... Twice.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
How long does this... Mania last?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Thank you.
What steps do we take now?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Yes?
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
Where?
Not our problem.
Mammoth.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
Where?
Come on Mr. Parker.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Is it a boy or a girl?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you think I should get?
Sparkling apple cider?
Are you working?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
If I was I'm sorry.
You OK out there?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... what you don't understand is...
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Let's stay for a while.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Don't hit me.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Harvard Law School?
But it's a top three school --
Why would I kill my husband?
Were you with another man?
Get up.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
What's going on?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
No. I was in the shower.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
What's the point?  Look at me.
How'd it go at the trial?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Josh proposed!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
She's not!
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
What're you doing here?!
You should. Do you have a resume?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Fire moat... why do that?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
You go to lady now?
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
Flozen foleva not good.
No, wait... please... listen...
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
I fear she's lost.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
The princess is dead.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Aye!  That too.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Blackheart?
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Worse than the battlefield.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
I should hope not!
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Is she... dead?
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
A good day for singing...
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Where?
I'll try.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
You promised!
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
Stop complaining.
Tis the truth.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Lili... I love you!
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
How do I get the horn back?
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
I'd be honored.
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Jest with me then.
How so?
What do we do now?
Up ahead!
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
What are you doing?
When does George get to come see his house?
I put him to work.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Where to?
I don't know.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Why?
Why are you so uptight?
Not really.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Are you guys' friends?
I hate to ask about a window.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
How's your wife?
Maybe...?
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
For everything.
Uh huh.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
To check up on me?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Are you totally insane?!
Why?
I don't beg.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
The gloves on the table are for you.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'm not even listening.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I gave up on you.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I still don't know what that means.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I need you to do me a favor.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
A blueprint spool.
Four days.  I left to think.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Hey, hey!
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Where's Sam?
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
What did I say?
That was the truth.
Let's not do this, okay?
Is your back still killing you?
No.  Mostly me.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Don't even...I'm there.
He said he heard hammering.
We've eaten.
To shave your chest?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You never really trusted me.
No.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
What did you say?
I brought a few of my own.
Go tell your father we're eating.
A night in the hole?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
What?
That's right, a loan officer.
What gave you that idea?
Still got that ten dollars?
You lost all our money in a card game?
It ain't here.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
No, man. I want you to have it.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
What does that mean?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
You still got that map?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I said you're soft.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Crop duster.
That's the way it is.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Don't make me take them away from you.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
I can't eat this.
I know you're not talking to me...
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Why ain't his pick swinging?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
I can't take that, mama.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Let her go.
We could create our own hell there.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Did you just talk?
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
What can I do about it?
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
You came through, Nicky.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Look who's back from the dead.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
You gotta kill yourself.
You smell like coconuts.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You got the wrong window again, man.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
It's freezing my hands.
Hey.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Your own work?
Had enough?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
You missed something special.
That was a great shot you made.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
No.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.
And?
Curious.
About what?
I'm listening.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
Six. I go red next year.
K.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.
You're not going, are you?
They won't listen.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
...But I still have the choice...?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
We can't. We're going back.
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
We'll have to bury him.
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
Are there any other humans?
Are you ready to put him in?
Not yet.
Yes...
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Why not?
His or ours?
I was here yesterday.
Me, too.
Hi.
How'd it happen, Alice?
Okay...
Are you my man?
Where's the bathroom?
The wife killer?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
A headache?
There's no other bedroom?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
What was that?!!!
What?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
They're gonna cook him.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Give that a try.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Why don't you like me?
All of it?
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Okay, brother.
I see.
That's ridiculous.
He might have lost his way.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
No kidding?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Yes.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
They were in a quandary, and—
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Chalmers Bryant!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
It's unbelievable.
Think of it! In times like these.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Well - I'm—
And the wine - excellent.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Oh, yes.
Well, it must have taken–
He amputated his own leg?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes.
What are these people?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
Nothing about the porters yet?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
I'd go mad!
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
My name's Sondra.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Thank you.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Hesitated, sir.
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
You don't know me at all.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
The radio show?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
You think that's what's-happening?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Do his job.
Sure.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Come on now.  People are smart.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
This it?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They're gone.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Is it now?
Drop some money.
Anderton --
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
About who?
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
You the only sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Tell me not to worry, John.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Uh-huh...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Yes, sir.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
We won't let them.
And who the hell is that?
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We can't grab it...
No maglev system.
Go ahead.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Flaws.
You gonna tell on me?
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She spoke to me.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
You're alive?
Once I even told him I loved him.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
What about the picture --
You're not gonna kill me...
Something wrong?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
What's so funny?
You don't seem all that proud.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Not if I stay away from him.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Where?
-- and then walk out.
John?
Then how did he --
Who?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
What?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
This your work?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
You know I need to use you.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
What are you talking about?
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
What's 'incidentals?'
Is it a good room?
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Holy shit.
He's okay.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Hello.
Chloe?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
You driving her?
So, when's the drop.
What's that?
Where is this happening?
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Ricky's taken care of.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Why?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Yeah.
Ruiz knows about this?
You told him you liked him.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Where's the drop?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Any time, bro.
It's not losing record.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
You wanna go right now?
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
I'll get the girl.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Yeah, I guess.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Nothing.
This is bullshit, man.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
You fucking nuts?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Let's check out the penguins.
The penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
All the more reason.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Why?
You're out of money?
Let's just go now and wait.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
How much is what?
'Strapped?'
You really in trouble?
Stop.
I'm half Irish.
No?
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Is it nice?
You're from LA, right?
Sure. You boys want anything?
We're square.
Can I borrow a piece of --
Keys.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Dip?
I'll get it.
Heard where?
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Man's rep travels.
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Daddy, where's my money?
You're a damn liar.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
I'll give you back the 600.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
What did you give it to me for then?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Where am I gonna start?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I sure met some.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
The talk is everywhere!
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Why don't you just ask your question?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Just what are you saying?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
If you want to tell me.
Did you see the papers today?
What?
Is she hooking?
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
Your control over your children, therefore --
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
How many you turning out?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Another one?
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
That's a fine chick.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
So what about him?
I'm the man.
Who the hell are they?
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
I don't know shit about you.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
Where do I find you?
[Si.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[I believe you.]
Who's he?
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[What do you mean?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[The ransom was ten.]
Yes.
Is it loaded?
I drink.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
No.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Did you sleep alright?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Jordan!
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Planned what?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
I like him, Mom.
Creasy.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
Two tourists who never went home.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Oh, yeah.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
What makes you say that?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
We just talked.
Hey! What are you doing here?
Well, it ain't your baby.
Ah?
What they say?
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Who?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
You come up here often?
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Yes, I know.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
I'd like that very much.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
No, I'm not kidding.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
That's the one.
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Sure.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy...
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
What do you want me to do?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Y'all mind the store.
So long, Ho-Jon.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Is that liquor?
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
You betcher ass, Dad.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
We stand behind all our work.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
No, no, that one.
It's in pretty deep.
All of them?
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Something else we have in common.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Why would he do that?
You really say the cutest things.
Why can't you look at him?
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
There's only one worth noticing.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
What's wrong with you?
Yes, sir?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Morning, Radar. How were things?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Nice.
Huh?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
How much money do you get?
The Websters.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Wait a minute . . .
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
Say that again.
You made it up.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Well, you're catching on.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
That's our man. He's made to order.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Have you seen him?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Had any schooling?
What do you do when you work?
Where is she?
Did you find her?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
What?
What do they want?
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Help yourself.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
How could he be a fake? 
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Four bits.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well?
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
What difference does that make?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
What?
SWAT wants to go in.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
Not that we know of.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
You're my hero.
No shit! He's good!
Apartment 306.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
You don't have to come here.
Is that all?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
National Marksman Competition.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
Is there something wrong with that?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
So what do I say to this guy?
What did you see?
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Have you evacuated anyone?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Scott...
The hell I am!
Where's the damn wire?!
Who's running it?
Who's running it!
Why --
What's happening?
It's time to wake up.
Wake up?!
Yes.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
You sure he's going to come?
But what if he doesn't --
We're going to have to reconfigure.
The maze has been changed --
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
One condition.
What?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Where?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
It was a test.
And it meant something.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
It was just there.
Standard, modern, upscale --
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Yeah, right.
I can hardly walk...
Release the power WITH the power.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
You okay?
That's the only way to the Monolith...
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
And how do we do that?
I'm outta here.
What do you mean "basically"?
How'd you know?
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Anybody see them?
We're asking you to go to prison.
The goddamned bastards.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
What do you mean?
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
You ain't even a man yet.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Well...
Luciano.
I'm doin' business here!
We'll figure out something.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
You bastards, I said twenty!
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
I like that.
This business is about taking risks.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Where we headed?
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
What about the share.
And what do you want out of this?
Wanna know what I think?
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Where's the stiff?
Take any one ya like.
What?
Uhh - martini?
Olive or eyeball?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Holy shit.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Mother!
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
So, you come here all by yourself?
You mean it's dangerous?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
This way?
I see.  How much?
Forty-five all total.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Thanks very much, sonny--
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
My friends?
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
Have *you*?
Where?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Huh?
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
What is it?
Are you ready for him, Bill?
He's batty!
What!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Mr. President!
Will the Senator yield?
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Yes, I was--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Nonsense, Jeff.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
No, Jeff--please--!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
No. What had you better--?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
The Steering Committee.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Try sitting down.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Go right ahead.
Terrible, thank you.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
It *is* not!
Letitia.
I've got more. You better tell me.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Then you *did* say it.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Well! You don't say!
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Susan!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
What do you want, Senator?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Maybe he won't get up.
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
How nice.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield?
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Good morning.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Are you married?
Thank you very much.
No. Are you?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Feel better now?
Tell me more about yourself.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
That depends on what they see.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
What did you mean by that?
I've often thought about going back.
He did? I play the tuba—
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
People have been crucified before.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Did it?
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Sit over there, will you?
How is this, sir?
We'll send for the police!
He's what?
It's a lie!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Will you have a cigar?
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Have a drink?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Ja.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Yes, sir.
Huh?
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
That ought to be fun.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Yes, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Uh-huh. What are they?
Doubtful. What did he say?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
I'm fine.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Why? I'm paying for this.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Go to hell.
I was... never satisfied.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
And the Brocketts?
He told you.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Hello, Lionel.
Is she a friend of yours?
When did you start to feel this way?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Hmm.
Even if you don't think it's real?
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Mom's such a cutie.
Something's bothering her.
Please... forgive me.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Disgusting.
It's all right.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Transference!
I guess you saw the show...?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
That's not quite what I said --
He agreed?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Amazing.
Hey, Skip.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Slash what?
Did you carry a gun?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Really?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Relax, I got him.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
What is he doing here?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Fifty percent.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
I just decked your brother
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Yes?
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
I was mistaken.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
And what's that?
Your mind is so slippery.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
When was that?
Who are you?
Eat your mustard.
It's me... Elizabeth.
That boy's got talent.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
I admire you.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
What?
When are you going to take off that mask?
Oh don't start that again --
I'm liking this.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
Nah.
So you're chicken?
Or flowers.
Let's go.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Maybe there was traffic.
Roy --
Wow.
Really?
Jeffrey!
You did?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Be a Mohican.
Oh no.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
And who is defending Paris?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Ajaccio.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
And he sent you to me?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Oh...?
What's your name?
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
No.
Of course.
Yes.
I cannot promise you that.
Promise.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Five minutes.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
That's all I can say.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
About Hippolyte Charles.
I know.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
And, where did you see my portrait?
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
No.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Alright, I'll remember that.
You paid cash?
No.  Thought he was with you.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Nobody!
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
I can't taste nothing.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Blow.
You make it sound so easy.
Hello, remember me?
Delivery!
Can I help you?
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
It's alright.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Smokin' what?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
What it say?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Thanks for the help.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
I got fired too.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
What urgent message?
What?
Ezal!  Ezal!
Hey, what's going on?
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
What you doing to my nephew?
I threw my back, again.
I...
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Could I see some identification, sir?
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
We have to hurry.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No. Kisses to you.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Who?
What am I supposed to say to her?
What are you going to do!?
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
What?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Close your eyes.
A surprise?
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Where's your Mom?
Yes, Dad.
And the Lord told that man --
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
I tried to save her.
Why?
Where are we goin', John?
Huh?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Now: Where?
Now it's your turn.
What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
No.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Yes; from the first night.
How's that?
Get up, Willa.
Do you want more children, Willa?
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Oh my god, oh my god...
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Because he was scary, that's why.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Okay?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
What!?
You used me, daddy!
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Nan, I --
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
What's the Coroner got to say?
She lived there.
Did you sleep?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights?
Good evening, Anna.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
I have nothing to hide.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
He's cutting our throat...
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Let's do that.
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Give me another double brandy.
Business.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
I think so too.
No visa.
On what?
What for... why?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Suppress it.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is that customary?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
That is correct.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet? Did you really?
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Was that talkative?
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
What are you after?
Why?
No.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
You see? Life can be so simple.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Are we going to build our little house?
...and we won't clench our fist...
Let's turn on the radio.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Those newspaper people?
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
You can't imagine.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Months, Swana.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
We have nothing to discuss.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Where are they?
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Unfortunately.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
May I ask what has happened?
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
You did say it, sir.
Where the hell is he?
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Son of a bitch.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
I figured that out.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
The country's loving it.
No, you didn't, Bob.
What about England?
Sorry ...
I don't have a pistol.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
About a dozen.
Cox!  Fire him.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
The army?
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
All right.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
Jesus!
You never told him?
Sir?
Sir?
I believe you're right, boss.
Sir?
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Winning?
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Why?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
We got the press this time!
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
Sir?
Proud?
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
Amen to that.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Anything.
Because ... I have to relax.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Lost.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
How many a those things you got now?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Want a cup?
In Angola. Yeah.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
You sure?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Okay.
How's that, Sheriff?
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I never do.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
No.
No.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Yeah.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What airport would you use.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Yes.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Is somethin' wrong?
...What time do you go to bed.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
For what?
Just call it.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
I didn't put nothin' up.
How's that?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Well enough.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Not any way.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
I didn't say braze.
What did I say?
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
The heroin. You don't have it.
You do, I reckon.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Don't jack with me.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
What outfit.
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Sheriff, I don't...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
...plenty
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Oww, the arm, the arm!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Do you know why I'm here?
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
...I don't think I know that hospital.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Umm... yes. Back home.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
The LeSabre!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Didn't I?
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Ad lib?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I don't know.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Really?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
So why'd you come to L.A.?
The one you were telling me about?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Does he know you think he's real?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
No, that should be more than --
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
What do you mean?
Of what?
I don't follow...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Like what?
That is so right.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I wanted to make a statement.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
We should go.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
It just didn't fit her profile...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
This is Betty at twelve.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
I see.  May I?
I'll think about it.
Hmm?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Yeah?
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
You can't do this -
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
What do we do now, Everett?
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
What's his name again?
Latch right on to that tit.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
But...
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Yes, Sir.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
No.
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
No, sir.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Vietnam?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
You're sure it's okay?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
He ask you out for next weekend?
You hope.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
You got a girl?
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
That was great.
Twenty-two years ago.
I'm looking for Sid.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
That's brilliant.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
What if she called the cops?
I have the gun.
One.  Squeeze.
This is ridiculous...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
Fuck!
They're not supposed to be here!
Asshole.
Be quiet.
Cell phone.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Could the child please stop that?
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
Cut it back a little bit.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Don't.
It doesn't work?!
What do they want?
Wait.
I heard you.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Blue is phones?
Call Dad!
He'll do something.
Uh uh.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
I'm sorry.
What?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
What's up?
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
I don't know. Look around man.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Nothing.
Motherfuckers...
My Mom's at that.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Yeah.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Well?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
I said, I'm not my sister.
Do you?
My pleasure, sir.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
That one is a bit more difficult.
I consider them linked.
Sir?
What news?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
You're in no condition to ride.
Flanking riders?
No...
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Thirteen years...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
And your principles?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Not held, just slowed down.
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Father, you can't let them take him...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
What's up, sugar?
Hey--they actually found the place!
What were you listening to?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
You keep saying that.
I guess so...but...
Can I have another one?
What?
It's Ellie's cat.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Getting there.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Can I trust you?
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
What?
That would hardly be proper.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
You?!
Me!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Raise the sails.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
We had time to get to know each other.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
Why ask me?
Why are brothering with that?
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Are you certain this is the right way?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I don't believe this is happening...
Is that what Argon told you?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
What's it smell like?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
They did it to me!
We don't?
Why do we need it?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Look at this!
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Blame the victim.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
What in the...?
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
I remember I was trying to help...
We were different people then.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
That's impossible.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
I could have you fired right now.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
I think I better go, Stew.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Not on my own beat, no.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
What play?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Yes.
I bet.
The boss is getting hoarse.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Well!
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
It's the smoke.
Not since you broke into society.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Nothing.
I dyed one and washed the other.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Okay.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Right.
A statement? Good.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
With pleasure, Madame!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Found no skeletons?
Yes sir.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
... Sex.
Thank you.
No she's not.
What is that?
How was your day?
I told you where I was.
I don't believe it.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
She won't go out with me?
Okay, that's IT!!!
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
That's not going to happen!
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Do you know that it's illegal?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
What?
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Just take deep breaths.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Those are my friends.
Jen, listen ...
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
You have no right to do this.
They're happy like this.
Not directly anyhow ...
Nothing.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Sure ... Where would we go?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
You want some berries?
Where are they?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Don't get upset.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Excuse me?
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
There's worse places.
What's wrong?
What?
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Forget about that!
Why?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Hi.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Yes, I'll be there.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
What city?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Why's it here?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Hi. This is Jack.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
We got disconnected before....
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
No.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Business is good, you're busy?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Ok.
About six months.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....yeah....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Nothing.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
This is Lena.
That was good.
I don't freak out very often.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Where you married?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
It's ok to ask that.
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
No.
You're hand is bleeding.
Why?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Can I ask how much is this?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
337.....I'm sorry....
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
Now are you threatening me, dick?
I'll say whatever I want --
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
That's that.
Yeah.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Yeah.
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
You should go on a trip.
....now: this pudding?
Well....what do you want, then?
I'm serious.
I know.
Ok.
You can't be late though.
I don't really remember that.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Nothing.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
At your service, Count.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Ow!
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
By whom? The Marquis?
What? What've I done?
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
It's not even noon --
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
You always do.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
His rug.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
Was it impotence?
I'm here.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Do you favor its publication?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
...yes, I've got that bit...
Good God, Marquise --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
You know that can't happen.
Why is that, Louis?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
There's nothing to explain
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
I want blood
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Jesus
Oh for Christ's sake-
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
They don't have to.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Craig is one syllable
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You gonna watch?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Thank you-
It came.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Jesus
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
What's wrong?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Stick out your hands, Jake.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
How's that?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Nine o'clock.
Yeah. At night.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
It feels real good.
I can't find my ball.
Jake...
I like the gym smell.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
What's the matter with you?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Jake, no --
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I dunno.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
But his leg!
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
A detective's nightmare.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Jefferies.
Read some good books.
Something wrong?
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Who are you?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Can you get me that ring back?
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
A Federal offense.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
What?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
No.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Ten here.
Hello.
Yes.
Not too active.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
You mean leave the magazine?
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Of course not.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean "goodnight."
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
What is it you're looking for?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Yeah.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
What about it?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Inside stuff?
That's what the witnesses told him.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I do?
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Huh?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
What time is it?
You can't protect me.
Yeah!  Shh!
Yes.
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
I don't think so--
You don't?
Sorry.
Excuse us a minute?
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
What?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Judy.
Let's see how long we can stay under.
I came here before.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
No.  At dawn.
Why?
Who's that?
Mom--I'm not--
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
No.
No.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Plato!
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Where what was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Who lives?
Won't mother be proud.
You going there?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Well--we're newlyweds.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Hi, Plato!
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
I'll never get close to anybody.
She's being called for.
No.  Why?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Must have a way with stationery.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Toys for... adults?
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, c'mon --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me again.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Beauty and fragrances.
...the truck driver...
Nick --
You're in on this.
Nick died for me....
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Don't say my name...
I don't know...
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
No --
You're not Nick Mason...
Yes!
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You got one hour.
Don't tip.
No way.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I can't go back to Vegas...
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Mr. Bangs.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Merlin, I didn't know --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Yeah.
What, working security?
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
GUARD! GUARD!
Ash... Ashley...
But... I had a five...
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Without having them hit the alarms.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Bullshit.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
Me and Mr. White?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Tell me more about Cabot.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Give me my book.
What's she doin' now?
He don't tip.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Follow you where?
You didn't ask.
Joe.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Dead.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
No real people?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
I don't know anybody.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Is that supposed to be funny?
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Not these guys.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
He's learning his letters.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
But the rest is right.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
What was he in jail for?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Finished, son?
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
What is it?
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Even women?
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
I tried my best, but these things take time.
You're not giving up?
Clay Phillips.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
That's the end of the line.
But you're his brother.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Me, too. 101?
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Where's Shorty?
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Where the hell are we?
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Listen to me I --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Oh, right.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Both of them?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
We? What do you mean... we?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Got a problem with that?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
The image there.
You're not wearing a belt.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Father, are you okay?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Get out?! What does it say?
What a bitch!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Who wants fruit salad?
It's sugarless.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
Are we leaving?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
And that was all?
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
A job?
The people at the restaurant?
 What have you done about Irving August?
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Do you think he knows about this?
Could you find him?
She'll have to know some time.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
No!
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Jason, my pet ——
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Tell me what?
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
But you would like to know where she is?
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
That was quick.
No. Why?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
What's the first?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Do you want me to?
You're what?
Aren't you?
You went out with her?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
What... what are these interviews about?
Like what?
You just ask them questions?
And they just answer them?
This is just... so...
You know?
How did you know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Yes.
About who?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Don't you get lonely?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
That's very flattering.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Yes.
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Why not?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Come on!!
John?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I'm not either!!
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
God damn you!!
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
When did you begin having this feeling?
Radon leakage?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I have a pretty good idea.
Let me talk to him first.
And what?
Will you stop? Jesus.
I just thought it might --
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Apparently.
What!?
I wanted him to see me.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Here it is.
I was just trying to --
Do I know you?
You want me to leave?
Nope.
Nothing.
That's all.
How long will it take?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Afraid of getting caught?
Cynthia. John.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Why not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
God, you... you're mean.
Everybody has a past.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
I like having the car, the car is important.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
IBM.
Brian Kirkland, please.
Yeah.
Jesus!
You knew these people?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Medical clinic?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Gonna cut me open?
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Who was she?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
But...how?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
We're the experts.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Yes, Betty.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
He was a President.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
Poor Brad.
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I love you.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And?
What do you think?
They're from both of us.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Stephanie.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
No, I'm an actor.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
This is rose, right?
What do you smell?
If that's what feels right.
She works for tips!
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
How do you know?
So what's the plan today?
Miles.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
What?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Count me out.
You should call her.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
With Maya.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
What's that?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
You said it looked like a car accident.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Hi.
How long have you been into wine?
What was the bottle that did it?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Well, nice to see you now.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Where are you?
That's great.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
How much skin and stem contact?
About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
This one?
This one?
It tastes funny.
...Tell Graham --
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Are you going to do this or what?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
They're on the roof.
How many died?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
Morgan?
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Dad.
It's the strangest thing Father.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Ten A.M.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
What's Turley like?
I expect.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
I'll see you around.
Where is Rae?
What happened?
That's a lie.
Because they don't like what I want.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
This a friend of yours?
Who is he?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Hello, Rae.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
What's she got to do with it?
And I know what I'm talking about.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Why isn't she with you?
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Better late than never.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
When is she coming over?
Impossible.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
How much wine have you had?
Hello?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
You never were together, Hal.
Clyde.
Body double.
Good for you, Hank.
I've seen them all before.
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
What's that?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Me too.
Is she here tonight?
I read.
Good-night, Daddy.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Why didn't she thank you?
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
Don't you?
It's a hotel.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Yes.
Thank you.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
All your soldiers speak Latin?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
I don't tell her a thing.
Know what?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
That isn't magic.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
I don't know.
I have to.
You weren't a paper champion.
Yes.
Yes, it did.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
You were great in the play, Cole.
And you know what else?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
They?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Could take a little while, though.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Come on --
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Hey. Fuck you.
Curt Cobain.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Shit!
Yes!
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Yeah?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Getting ready.
Look. You want to talk about this?
What are --
Suzie... No.
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Get out of here.
...no... Mac... p-please...
What is it?!!
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
No. What…?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
What are you doing?!
What?
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Rorschach.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Are you nodding?
Sorry.
Where are you going?
You're my princess, aren't you?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
A what?
Driving, talking to me...
Shoot.
Hey...
See ya, Kate.
Kate...
What can I say?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Go.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Bandit I, do you copy?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
I think you're just yellow.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
And a very bad gamble.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
No.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...I forgive you Darwin.
Damn... alright then.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
Yeah, we've been through that.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Your attitude sucks.
I could have it sent out...
Without peer?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
What are you doing here?
You're finished.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
... Jesus... what for?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
A million flat.
No shit.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
-- never in a million girl --
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
You fucking bastard...
How quickly?
Rheya.
I don't know.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
You didn't look very happy.
You want to fuck her?
Is it a planet?
Is it intelligent?
It's something.
You still don't believe in God?
What happened?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What does Snow think you should do?
I love you.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
When?
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Didn't do very well, did you?
They're kind of fuzzy.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
So it was "love".
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
Tell it like it is.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Yeah.
Not exactly.
Pretty bad.
I'd miss my life...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Your what...?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
What shit, honey?
I'd identify him.
Bought it.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
Why?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
What?
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What're you talking about --
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Let me drive...
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
Does it make you... hard?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Lay back, Mack.
How about dinner tonight?
She's taking singing lessons.
Here you go, Pete.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Flash, drop it--
Harry…
Don't be pitiful.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Would you cool it already?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Good morning, Liz.
I hate people with alliterative names.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
But you like that in a man?
Does it have a human name?
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
You sure about all this?
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
A match made in heaven.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I will finish what I've begun…
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
How much do you know about it?
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Need any more help?
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Like it?
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Bonkers.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Jawohl.
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
That's right.
Then we're all in on it?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Shut up, Animal!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Let me alone.
May I have this dance, Miss?
Betty! Betty!
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
What about Schulz?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
What radio?
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Says who?
Says me.
You off your rocker?
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
What did you say?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
We have no radio.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
It's working.
What do you mean?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Well, may we have a look around?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
I thought you might.
Aye.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Status!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Response?
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
What did you see, Chekov?
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Aye sir, coding now.
Locate.
Could it be Spock's?
Why don't we beam it up?
Hello, sir. It's David.
David, I don't understand...
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Logic indicates that is the case.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I don't understand.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
None that I can detect, sir.
Captain, what's happening?!
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Sir...?
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Just him, sir!
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
What? What are you saying?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.

He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Sir, may I suggest --
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Sir, may I --
Good for you, Lieutenant.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
It never rains but when it pours --
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
We'll lose them if they go in there.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Yes, SIR.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
The power of creation --
Gentlemen, this isn't --
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Kirk here.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
You earned it.
That was a little joke.
On screen...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Bones --
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
-- That's the general idea.
... My shoes...
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
The top of what?
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Can you protect us?
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Implicitly.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
What do you mean now?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
... Gone?!
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Hey! -- Where you going?!
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Thank you, Admiral.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Yes.
Spock...
I cannot tell a lie.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
... Aye sir...?
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
I have no control, sir!
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
How long, Scotty?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The explosive override -- ?
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
You have warp capability?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Don't you ever get tired?
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Are they in any danger?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Very funny...
Will he live?
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Implants bothering you?
Options?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Captain...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
You need a haircut, Commander.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Why would we be involved with these people?
What...?
But it's comfortable.
... I believe you...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
Good hunting. Hayes out.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Juice?
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
California. San Francisco.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
No... I'm from France.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Life signs?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
I remember it made me sick.
Riker here.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
I didn't mean this future.
That cunning little Vulcan...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
Yes...
Shields. Battle stations.
Aye, sir.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Your friends are late...
And your coat.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Just the prototype.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Sulu!
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
Me?
WE volunteered?
What is it?
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
WE SURRENDER.
Gorkon's own man??
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Praxis?
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
No.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
To new worlds...
Data!
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Yes, sir.
How long until we reach the fleet?
Why am I looking at me?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
If you wouldn't mind.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Imzadi. This is so good.
You're not here.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
How long until he can fire?
Sir, we're being hailed.
Not with the Romulans.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
That will never happen.
I won't do it.
To find the head, sir?
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Not very chatty.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
You know I need to verify this.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
I have no reason to.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Report!
No -- this is wasting time.
How long?
Praetor...
Praetor.
What did I tell you?
Thank you.
What do you do?
Do you have children?
No.
What do you think of America?
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
Recognize this?
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
When can we expect containment?
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Gear shift.
What?
I am husband?
Shit... shit... what shit?
Who?
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
What?
A drink.
I...
I will see it next time.
Sun...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Eh... yes...
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
You thought we were a different planet?!
Why?
I am not a good singer.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You don't forget anything, do you?
They are beautiful.
If you want to keep it, you can.
I will.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
Yes.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
I made my choice, Lenny.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
You talked to Iris?  When?
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
We should talk alone.
Talk to me about costs, here.
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
Naw.  She won't call me.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
So've I.  Too much.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
So there never was a death squad.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Nero.
Commissioner Strickland.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
What the fuck are you doing?
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Is this great fabric or what?
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
You sure?
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Take it to him.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Right.  That explains it.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Besides that.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Who knows.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
You have the photo from the diner?
Who?
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Do you think he singled you out?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
Why did you go to Chicago?
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Miss me, Dave?
Thanks for the ride.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
This is a sexy case.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
The other reason?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
What's this country coming to?
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
There are Agency regulations about this.
It's a no-no.
Just routine stuff.
Suspect Zero.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Agent Mackelway?
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Is he dead?
[Reality very risky.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Yes, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Speck is dead.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
You should call your Grandmother.
Don't do it, Mike.
What kind of car do you drive?
Yes. Like the quiche.
You too?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
Huh?
Why not?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
I'll be around.
You're a comedian?
Well, I should be getting...
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
What kind of things?
I miss you, Mike.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I didn't mention her once today.
An eight.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
It's unbelievable.
Well, you're doing so well...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Who threw this party, anyway?
How's it going for you two?
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Are you ready to order?
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Vegas, baby!
Cut that shit out.
Did she, or did she not smile?
We're gonna get laid, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
What was the part?
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
She didn't like me, anyway.
What?!?
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
Which one?
So, two days?
What the fuck..?
Now?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
Yes she did.
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
It's on...
Sorry man.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
The bear's got his claws back.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
I ask for Justice.
An eye for an eye!
What do you wish me to do?
Godfather!
Eat it, it's on the table.
You heard about your father?
Good for ten men...
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
No.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
Is it necessary?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
And with prison record.
But you needed a drink first.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
Barzini will move against you first.
You want him to stay in this country.
Corleone.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Mike!  The party starting!
That's for you to find out.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Jesus, I don't know...
What was that?
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Can you say it?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Where are you going?
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
What? What?
You'd say if you mind?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
This is so good of you.
I played piano in a few places.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Far cry from New York.
Tom.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
I never said that!
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
He hates being confronted.
Tom?
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I told you. He gave them to me.
It's all true.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
How would you know that?
Is this you?
What's your secret?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Which is?
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
You know what -- I am.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Will we see you later?
We'll be there.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
What did he say?
Or Tom and Peter even.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Yes?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
November, I thought.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Thank you.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
You want to canvass?
I don't know...
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Yeah.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Try holding the match like this.
This I gotta see.
Oh, are you all right?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Well... I guess so.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't like my real name.
Do they drug you?
But that one night?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
What should I do? Call the cops?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I sure hate to go alone...
Have you tried the telephone?
No.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
What's the action around?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Yeah.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Wrong.
Mason.  Mason?
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
What about you, Delly?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
What?
When did you start smoking?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
I... I need a drink of water.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Well...
I'm here.
Did I what?
A few.
The G-man?
Zackly.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
So, it is a blacklist.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Cigarette?
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
No, I...
That's my r-r-rent.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
They all know you?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Miss Hayworth?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I was wondering...
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Oh, I suppose so.
Are you coming to my party?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Lois!
Yep.
Right across the bay there.
Yes?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Mmmm.
Daniels.
I need her exact name, you see.
Shall I call the doctor?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Yes.
Yes.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Yes?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
They're gone. The same pattern.
We won't be here.
If they are?
Do I sound foolish to you?
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you like me to go for her?
Not by the thousands.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Oh.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
You like me, huh?
I'm sure.
Oh. That. Rome.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
But not for me.
What do you want ?
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Like what?
Helping travelers.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Really? Tell me about it.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Take wing!
How long have they been gathering there?
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Can we turn back?
There we are!
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Not if they're starting a war.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Mr. Gray?
Ask this one favor --
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
She's unconscious.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
What do you mean, Fettes?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Are you a doctor, too?
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
But what makes a thought start?
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
Only Brother.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Keep that thing away from me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
You're him. Corvis.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
What were you yelling about?
What is it?
It still doesn't mean...
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
Yes -- that is true.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
Yes -- of course.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Of course, dear.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
All right.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
We certainly did.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
You know about the United Nations?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Why not?
It must be twelve-thirty.
Where are you going now?
Who?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Would you like to sell it?
That's right.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
All together?
What's going' on?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
You have a T.V.?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
You like Michael.
He looks dead.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Sure.
We are...
Tell them to get something to eat.
I thought we were poor.
You've heard this story before?
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
No, I'm not...
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Who are you calling?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
You can't let anybody leave!
Finish what?
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Let's open it.  Now...
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
Look, I'm just guessing...
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Neither will we.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Now hold him.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
A couple of hours.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Tie up Clark, too.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
You jerking off or just pissed?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
So what do you make of it?
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
The Hall of Books.
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
What kind of stories?
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
We need your help.
Yes.
When was his mother taken?
Yes...
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
I won't leave you like this.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Why would you let me go back?
No...
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
May I help you?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
You know I can't.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Let's walk through the park...
My God...
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Where's the challenge in that?
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
For God's Sake, David --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
What is it?
Did you hear me, lad?
You're not from beyond the valley.
Why?
Why not?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
You lost someone.
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
Is it?
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Mara...?
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
Do you have it?!
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
Sir, if I may --
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
That's too bad.
And what's that?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
Did you know my father?
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
You two ok?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
I looked it up.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
But no one knew until after...
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
How long do we have?
You're sure?
They're not here.
They're not.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
I've been ok.
I never knew my father. Did you?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
It doesn't look all that different.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Because I don't have time.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Of course you don't know.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
[Beat] Why?
So you never knew your mother?
Hon?
You want anything special for dinner?
Why?
Who do you think did it?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
We're both fine.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Alright.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
What the fuck is going on?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Hey, peaches.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
In case of what?
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
What happened to your hair?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
You're disturbed.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Now what?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
I said all that?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
We can change our names.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
What?
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You women are crazy!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
We're fine!  How are you?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
What?
Huh? But why did Healy?
I am?
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Why's that?
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Am I?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
The sawbones?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
I beg your pardon?
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
-- He's in a cage?!
A surprise?
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Have you seen it?
Mary ah, forget it.
Urrggghh...
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
So she's married?
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Jai alai?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
That must make it tough.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
How do you guarantee that?
I can live with those reflections.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Bundt cake?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
You don't think they're too big?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Oh, are you on the team?
Are you all right?
And did everything -- ?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Ted...?
But but what about Steve?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
No, no, please!
Oh God.
So what's up?
How are you doing, Warren?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
The other thing is...
Zorin will eat him alive!
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
John. How much time?
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Let's get out of here.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
I don't want to listen to this again.
Hello?
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Hey. Nice tie.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
I see.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
I did.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
You've got no jurisdiction.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
He said he doesn't know.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Sorry.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
I desecrated it?
Your relatives must've taught you something.
X21, give me a 20.
What are you doing on the reservation?
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
That's a big comfort to me.
How did you know this was my car?
Yes, ma'am.
Two miles.
It never came up.
You let me make a fool of myself.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
The what?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
I'm different.
Does it bother you?
Are you really that brave?
It's just as I thought.
Why?
Danger?
I want it back.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
What truth?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Looks like a tie.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Let's hope you're right!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Yawing right.
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Is it the plane?
What do you want?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Something bothering you?
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
Mav's a great flyer but....
Figured it out yet?
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
I'm nothing like him.
What do you want?
Get it, please.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
But I thought...
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Suppose I do...then what?
What is it?
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Nobody.
Let me go!
Do what?
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Clever girl.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
No options.
Hauser left me a note.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Not bad, for a hooker.
I don't need Kuato for that.
He's lying.
Wait!
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
You know, up the jeep trail.
We're not going over there, right?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Somebody paying you to do this?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
You sure this is where it was?
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
You okay?
Think it's still following us?
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Ms. Vin's sister.
I have to talk to your brother.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Chinatown street gang.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
I feel much better now.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I'm not that desperate.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
But why?
...I'm dying out there.
-- How could I help you?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
'lo, Cecil.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What do you want?
Look. Mister --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
Get lost Bobby.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Here he comes.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
An old woman and her grandson.
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Yes...
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Shorthand. Really?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
That's what I heard.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
You didn't do your homework?
Noooo...
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Well, why not?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Do you want to talk?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
You missed somethin', Ed.
But Bob isn't real.
No... No...
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Did you make me a tape?
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
Not now.
This afternoon?
Trees?
What were you doing in my room?
Let me see.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
No.
Yes.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
When's the next business trip, big fella?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
And no one will know the truth.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...yes. Get her on the phone...
It looks that way.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
I...
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Neurology?
...of Anesthesiology?
I'm on the staff of...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
No further questions.
Yes.
Tell me one?
Yes!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I completely understand...
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
The Doctors were not negligent.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The most respected...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Hi.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
...things change.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Listen to me, fella...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Nothing further, your Honor...
You're talking like a drunk.
Is it over?
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Yes. Price...
Kathy Price.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
Nothing happened.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
...fifty thousand dollars?
...I understand...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Well, well, well. Huh?
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
Right.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
So what?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday. What?
You use their witness.
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
She did?
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
Should I?
Hey, how about that!
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
I do know him...slightly.
How does it happen cars are running?
Where are we?
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
They don't do much of anything...!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
What's up?
Doctor...
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Finish, please!
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Darker.  More...evil?
When do you think it'll be done?
What...happened?
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
You got it.  What's happening?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Me?  Why me?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Can I get you something to drink?
Did we lose anybody?
Why did we begin this?
Everyone aboard young Bill?
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Fifteen.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Do you have your ticket?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
It works?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
They have every right Chuck.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Spying?!
You do?
What?!  What's happening?!!
Son-of-a-bitch.
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
Me, too.
What's your problem?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
I couldn't do it.
They tell you that?
It matters to me.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
It's outta here!
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
I can't.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
It wasn't hard.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Why? He's right in the groove.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
This your car?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
No shit?!?! You know him?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
What?
What is it, Johnnie?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Why, honey?
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
What happened to him?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sailor!
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Who do?
You think he saw us?
Uh huh.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Now what?
Sailor?
Sail?
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Yes... Get rid of him.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Just tell me what you want.
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Explain it... I told you.
Where?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos... I can't...
Put your shoulders back.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Actually... I just want to go home.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
He said something about being between things.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
So. Is he any good?
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
That was good.
What's this guy's problem?
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
James? My James? What's happened?
Kidnapped? By who?
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
...we find the jacket.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
You peeked, didn't you?
I know.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
You?
What'd he say?
But... ?
Hm.
How's that?
So where have you been staying?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Colon cancer.
I never heard of it.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Kinship.
It feels really... good... here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
You coming?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going, with them.
Near Carvel?
Yes, James.
Me? Sure. Why?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
So what are you going to do?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
He cribbed that from Borges.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Chancellor.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Is that Cristaile?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Well...
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Who's that sitting in your car?
What's he doing out there?
Inside.
Would Walter really press charges?
He told you.
And what did you say?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
I need a ride.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
He's writing his name in water.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
No.
Yo, Traxler.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Beautiful. How's business?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
What?
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
Something like that.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Hiya, Walter.
I think you do.
Doesn't everybody?
It's not for sale.
They grow outside, don't they?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
What?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
So. How are you adjusting?
I'm twelve.
Walter.
How come?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Ms. Kramer.
Yes?
I said the job is okay.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
Bad idea.
Try it.
I'm still thinking about it.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
They usually tell me.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Is this the first one?
You're very late.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
Close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
No, I am not going to --
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Not so fast.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
In my bed too.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Don't ever do that again.
This is garbage!
I'm talking about you.
Very weird.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
What?
Why do you want to know?
So, you're not a dyke.
So, what did you do?
You're not joking.
I was always the one seduced.
You know, this is crazy.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
All three -- in chronological order.
You're scared.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Where are we?
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Wasn't up to me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
You dumb jarhead motherf--
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Oh God, Lins... I--
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
What's the matter with you?
Y'all could be more specific.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
Getting a reading?
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
Which one shall I wear?
But how could you say such a thing?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
And why haven't they left each other?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Why?
I don't love you.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
What happened?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
There too...
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
And who is this?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
And what did they say about me?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
But where did you come from?
Whose boat is that?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Is that far from here?
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
One of the other Sisters?
Because I'm getting fat.
Agnes...
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Should you see a doctor?
Love.
Uh huh.
Who?
At least once a week.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
What baby?
From God.
I... I don't understand.
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Are you married?
No.
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
Why do you smoke?
Do you know a Marie?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
What things?
Who?
Agnes...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
I was a mistake.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
No...
You can tell me.
She watches... she listens.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Yes?
And that you're stupid?
How does she know that?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Why?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
Yes.
Yes.
And the passage to the barn?
So I could go to him.
Stay away from me...
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
What did you do?
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Something they... that they overlooked.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
When?
I can get you new evidence next week.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
What business is it of yours..?
What man had access to her?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
This was before her pregnancy?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
The Catholic Church...
Aquittal.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.
Earthquakes?
Oh, Dear God...
When was that?
Sister Paul?
Oh God, if only I'd known.
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
And what has that to do with it?
No, it reminds me.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Do you want to become one?
Begin what?
Would it stop you if I did?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I'm concerned about her health.
This is permission to take her apart.
Is it because she's a nun?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Before or after you killed the child?
She can't remember.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah.
How about Ding Dong?
The police station.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
I don't snore.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Grotty?
But I won't.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
I beg your pardon?
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Gerron.
Sure. .
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
And cunning.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
What are you doing?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well, what are we waiting for?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
He's got you worried, then?
I hope he fell off.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Now get on with it.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Who?
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
I feel like shit...
Yeah.  Two hours.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Computer, what language was that?
Yes!
You like this shit?
Okay.
What happened to the lights?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
No, I don't want us separated.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
What do you mean?
Now we're in for it.
Yes.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
We're not going anywhere.
Look at that.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
This should do it.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Any microorganisms?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Engaged.
Yes!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
What did it do to you?
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Give or take.
And?
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Oh, man...
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Still got him?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Is it still moving?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
They've changed their heading again.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
There's still time to back-out.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Agreed.
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
Where'd you leave them?
Jesus.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
That's right.
Yes. The Shubert.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Paved with what, then?
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
Champion to champion.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
Then say so.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Frankly, I don't remember.
How nice.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
Huh?
Bill...
Knit me a muffler.
Then you're crazy.
I get a party, don't I?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
That never stopped you before.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
It's all over.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Paranoiac!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
What would you like? Texas?
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
A cowboy.
Hello, what's your name?
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.
I'm for it.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
Subway.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Hello, Miss Channing.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I don't intend to be.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Eve... don't cry.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I'll never get over it.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Addison wants me to play it.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Right here.
If you'd like.
I'd like to hear it.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
They're your fans, your audience-
How much time have we?
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
With tears.
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Lloyd, be careful...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
I have no intention of having an accident!
I mean really, deeply angry...
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I just played it.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Miss Caswell?  What?
Anything to help you out, Max.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
But what could she do?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Answer my question!
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--no way--
Carl?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--see?--
--I'm trying--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
And?--And?--
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
I hate both parties.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
Nah.  Maybe.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
You overslept?
What does it say?
Morning or night?
Night.
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
You can't.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--that was awhile ago--
--you don't really think you're being followed?
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Just tell me his title.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
What?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Haldeman too?
Howard Hunt here.
James McCord.
Are you sure?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
That was awhile ago.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Mr. Sloan?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
When so ordered.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Forget it.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Do you?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
You can send me the address too.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Can I come in?
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Dad!!
...excuse me?!
Who cares?
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Strip?
Tonight?
And I want to try to make it up to you.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
But you don't love me.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
That was a great night.
Then she said -- she loves me.
So does your tongue cramp up?
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Here, babe.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Either way works for us...
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Andy! Holy shit!
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
They're coming!
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
What...?
What does it say?
Whoa...
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Oh God. Shit...
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
You on drugs? Huh?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Uncle Terrence?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Well?
Saint Severin...
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Who did you hear it from?
You'll laugh.
Yes, your highness.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Every Russian family has one..
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
You'd lose your security deposit?
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
What do you mean?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Promise me she'll have her home.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Perhaps you could convince her?
Hey, you on television?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Hey!
What?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Yes.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
We've been through this.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Get him!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Well, where is it? I-
Oh, right.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Yeah, I know.
Well...
No, I got time.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
God bless.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
And we'll digest our food better.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
As Balzac said...
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
How is it any different?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Oh, you have my body.
Are yuh?
Yeah.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Okay, let me have this.
Oh, Jesus, really?
W-w-whatta you mean?
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Here's a real present.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Thanks, honey.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Oh!
Here you are. There's people out there.
Don't get upset!
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
Where are you going?
Man, that's great. That's just great.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Just give me the license, please.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
She was stealing.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Oh.
There were many men interested in you?
Did you know the contractor?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Would it make a difference?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
She's got great tits.
Oh.
I'd say it was down.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Why would she care?
Really.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Sally?
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Just did.  Jealous?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Escape hatch.
So?
I call that a perfect day.
I'm fine, babe.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
You only made half your quote this year.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It's not like this all the time.
I don't look my age, Joe.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Yes.
I know.
Happy anniversary.
He's my favorite.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Don't I find what?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Something soft.
No you're not.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Elitism?
I will treasure this.
Are you okay?
I think he's really angry with me too.
That's very nice.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Ready to go?
Not at all.
The charades.
That was my clue.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Panes is here!
Like the last time.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
I didn't know you had this.
I thought it was okay where it was.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Water...water...
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Out here I'm just what?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Z!  what are you doing?
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Oh, no, sir!
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Yes, what else?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
This the place?
Something the matter?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Well, I have some paper towels --
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Sure.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
How come?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Marry Christmas.
One more?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Of course not.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Who?
Baxter.
What's her first name?
I'm not very good at it.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Why not?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
I just want some fresh air.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I don't want to talk to him.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
I guess so.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
Are we dressing for dinner?
No -- just come as you are.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm fine all over.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
To me?
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Don't mind what?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
You?
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Mr. Sheldrake?
What do you want?
You can't come in.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
How many pills were in that bottle?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Something like that.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
No kidding.
Good night.
Kubelik.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
I took sleeping pills.
How long has it been -- a month?
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
Handle what?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Yeah, we better.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
What are you talking about?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
Esprit de corps --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Moonby what?
How about a drink ?
Delta ?
Let's talk about you.
Tracks ?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Yes, sir --
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
No shit.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Smoke !
Who knows what's up there?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
Charlie?
What -- happened here.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
They far enough?
Change.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Fucking savages.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Do you?
How's yours?
I think think a lie stinks.
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
Why?
Why didn't he shoot you?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
What's a big question?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
I know.
Right now -- I am.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
134  CONTINUED:
215  CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
184  CONTINUED:
How did she..?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Stay here.
Thanks.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
That's not what I meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
I'm here to do my job.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
You better get some sleep.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Alleged killer.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Go ahead.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Since forever.
Emergency room only.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
So you'll be at work?
Lovely.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
I was going to do that for you.
Hey -- you let him...
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
You don't owe me that.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
Were you asleep?
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Stop staring. Do a vase.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
What?
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Oh, is he dead?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
I brought you Chinese soup.
Melvin...
You consider your life easy.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
So you're practically finished, huh?
What restaurant?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Bain.  Michael Bain.
How long have you been freelance?
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
I ain't scared of you.
What?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Sick.  The flu.
I bet you fucking know!
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Bullshit.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Why?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
How?
Had?
Why?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
More or less.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
My first take?
Because I want to know.
Are they usually like that?
Thinking.
Oh.  What do you think about?
Do you think about the game?
Do you think he's here?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
I told you, he will.
Yes.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Ten years ago.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
I think I got one today.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
I went into their room this afternoon.
What?
Jesus, if someone had --
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Did he explain how this happened?
Why?
I'm sure you will.
Why?
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Shit.
Electra --
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Would you like a drink?
Sure.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
It's a common question.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Why didn't you fade?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
I've been saying that since we met.
Can you do the lock on it?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Perfect!
Why don't we go together?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
What happened to Katka?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Tell me some bad news?
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
WE gotta think of something.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
God, I think I need a holiday.
Some deal you did there!
What?
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
You used to read.
What?
What? You are crazy!
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Forget about me Kat.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Okay?
How?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
How do I know what's being said?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Is it dry?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
But I have to finish this....
You are responsible...What has happened?
What are you an idiot!
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
So go dance.
You're fine like that, Mom.
To see your father?
Late night.  You?
Yeah.
I could take after Dad, too.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Hypotheticals --
Landon!
Can't you have a normal conversation?
-- Your act only works with an audience.
You got some kind of list?
I know. Don't say anything.
Saturn. Beautiful.
My relationship with God is my own.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
People can see.
It's only 7:30.
You make me feel...
Assholes. This happen to you?
That what you do?
Jamie --
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
It was a play.
I'm no dummy.
I'd work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
For Jefferson High. For books.
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
So what did we just make?
Yes, sir!
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
But he didn't ask me.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Uh, hi, Eileen.
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Why?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Operator, what's today's date?
What year?
What?!
Pro, the sun's out!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Hi, Marty!
He said not to tell.
That's what he told you, huh?
You ever held another job before?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Then why'd you do it?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Well, Kit...
What'd you come out here for?
It's okay.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Spanish.
Don't call me stupid.
Look at all this junk.
What'd you put him in there for?
Yeah.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
No.
Positive?
What?
Yeah.
Hi.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
It's mine all right.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
What is it, Tommy?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Another 'you'?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
You keep an eye on it.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Pictures don't lie.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Why me?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Well... THIS.
Before what?
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
...This'll sometimes help.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Go ahead, son.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
You gotta believe me –
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
...Yes, thank you.
I – Mr. Lipnik –
Mr. Lipnik, I –
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
Congratulations.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Big fuckin' deal.
Anyway.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What did she tell me, Beth?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
Why not?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
Ice?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No thanks.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Somebody has to die.
It teaches you to lie.
Were there ever any suspects?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
What's goin' down, son?
Catherine says you don't like her.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Keep your three o'clock.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
What do you think?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
It's in New York.
Ignorant art?
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Do you still love her?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
That was my favorite part!
These are great.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Who did this?  Who did this?
B.B. It's me – Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Would you like to see the wine list?
It's Andy again.
You're shattering all my myths.
What's the rush, John Henry?
Good.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
I hadn't thought about it.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Hi.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You like your dad's paintings?
'Phillips head,' right?
Uh-oh!
It's cold.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
What're you really after?
Pouring myself into my work.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Photojournalist.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Son!
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Working late?  I'm touched.
What is it?
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
I am as well as can be expected.
It's good to see you.
Specify, please.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
What is it?
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
I see you knew him.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
What?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
She wants to kill you.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
Our work?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Up here, Al.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
We'll talk some other -
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Wacko? That a technical term?
But...
Why do you do that?
What?
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't-.
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
...Not the bat?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
Bruce, you can't.
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
_We_ sure are.
Holy shit.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
Where's the boy?
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
What are you talking about?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
What did you see?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
What are you, scared of heights?
I understand.
And what happens if we say no?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
And you want a --
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
What were you thinking?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Scottish.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
0 my god.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
And howls Alison?
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
I beg your pardon?
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Sure did.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Why thank you sir.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
And Boot-Head.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Ah, the witness?
You got two seconds!
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Won't?  Or can't?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
My God, we're back where we started.
Of course I did.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
Are you available?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
I think so.
Yeah.
I don't know what that signal means.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
... sheets.
Are they suffering?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Is this the key to the attic?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Their wedding clothes.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
... And please call me Robert.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
I would like to walk today.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
My name is Chance.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
What is that?
Thank you, Eve.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
No. I'm not busy.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Can you see well?
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Yes. I am very hungry.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Yes. I would like to do that.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Does it have a television?
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Yes.
Yes.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Correct.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Yes, I will.
... Nothing.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Look, Johanna...
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
This is not what I requested.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Thank you, Colonel.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Malkovich.
What?
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Why not?
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
I've fallen in love.
Lotte? Is that you?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
No. Don't be an ass.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Forget it.
Says who?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
No you mustn't, my child.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
No.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
We have to meet.
She's not available.
How do we do that?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
No.
Do you mind?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Vegas.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
I likes yellow.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
WILL YOU STAY?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Yes sir
Yes ma'am.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
You sure?
I know what I see.
He's sleeping in the church.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
It ain't what you think.
She was only-
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Make it the way I always do.
Yes sir.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
This is our concern, Dude.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
They range up to three thousand.
Where you going, Dude?
I am the Walrus.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
I've had a--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Oh yeah?
Huh?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Well--sure, I could do that--
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Increases?
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
So...that doctor.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck are you--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
The what?
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
Easy, Dude.
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Now Dude--
Huh?
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Who the fuck is that?
Not exactly a lightweight.
Uh.
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
What's your point, Dude?
Yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Call the medics, Dude.
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Dude.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Well?  Aren't you?
You monsters!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Impressive.
Two years.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
What?
Anyone else make it?
You're hurting me.
How do you feel?
Did you think I wouldn't?
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
You got something in mind, Blade?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Pretty.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
She's been bitten.
What took you so long?
Going somewhere?
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
-- he's a vampire.
Why?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
How can you tell?
What am I injecting you with?
Is he sick?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
You're a week early.
How could you be a part of this?
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
How do you like that? Right on time.
How many of you are there?
What happens then?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
Inside the grave?
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Druid Hill Park.
--the witch kills children--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
You sure?
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
--or someone--
Nothing. I dunno--
--you should get back into bed.
Was that you laughing?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
--like you hurt the baby--
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
How'd you know they were--
I don't think it was them.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
Turn the tapes back on.
Okay, a blur.
--go!
So lemme see it.
--Cotter: shut up.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Yeah. Me too.
--who?
Cotter?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Oooh. Oooh.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
--bullshit--
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
I should check on Anna.
"It's why the witch kills children."
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
What happened to my Dad??
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Meurice--
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Who was it?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Uh-huh.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What?
See, I never knew that.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?
Yeah. Is it...
...What?
Has Ray come in yet?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Howdy stranger.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Is Marty here?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Jeffrey nothing.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Oh shit.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Dorothy. no!
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I guess I should go.
They hurt his head.
Don?. Where is he?
I don't want to go.
What are you lookin' at?
Nothing.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
What happened to him?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Alright.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
What's with Mike?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
No Jeffrey!!
Are you feeling okay?
How ya doin' Dad?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Yeah?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
That sounds great!
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Blanca, por favor.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
You happy, baby?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Mirtha.
I don't know...
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Goodness.
Not really, no.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Good night.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
What's the matter, George?
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Diego?
I'm sorry, George.
Not mad.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Tell Mom, you know...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
I meant every word of it.
I don't think so.
I don't know.  My name is George.
Pablo said no?
But this is...
I said, I've seen it before.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
How are you doing?
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Where are you going?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I fucked up.
Yes, I do.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Stoned?
Yeah?
No shit, Kevin?
I understand. What's your question?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
What ... What must I decide?
I don't even know your name yet ...
Go away!
But it's not even midnight yet!
A name?
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Who is speaking?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
I've been waiting for you to get back.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
What about the will?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Objection, Your Honor.
Can you?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
Her name?
Six years.
No -- never.
Who found him?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes.
What did she say?
I was angry.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
I heard him say it.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
We dated for about a month last year.
How do you know that?
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
Yes.
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Yes.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
No pain, no gain?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I'm the photographer.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Yeah.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
You lied to me!
Rebecca -- take these off.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
That wasn't the deal.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
I am relaxing.
She sounds like quite a woman.
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
I know.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
It's not that long.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
No treasure maps, huh?
What?!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
'82.
Grateful!?
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Bar across the street.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
I never knew that.
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
No.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
No, really?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Smells like dirt.
You get used to it.
What?
Are you all right?
You really don't need anyone?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I'll pick you up.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Are you hungry?
I sat outside and had coffee.
I had a temper.
I... What do you want?
Well, what is this?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
You feeling better Franny?
Where you going?
I'm positive.
I'm going to miss you.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Apparently just before her death.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Is this Hell?
What else?  Money.
Those 'fools' are my people.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aren't you going to join us?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Lucky thing.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Did you do it?
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
Please...help me...
What building?
I didn't sell it.
You was just doing your job.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Open the case!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Jesus, Caesar!
What are you talking about?
It was him.  I'm positive.
It's impossible!
But you know he did it.
Violet, please!
You can't leave.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Fuck.
What did she do to you?
We were in a car accident --
You know he would have done you, too.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Why?
I had to see you.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
How long have you been with him?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
Yes.
Johnnie?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
I was so afraid you ...
Oh, God.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Forget it.
Treadstone.
...they won't let you go...
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Look, maybe I should just...
His brother.  You know his brother?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Excuse me?
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
What if I say no?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
That's what I'm saying.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- there's no time --
What is that?
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
What about you?
This your store?
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
Sir...
What?
What the fuck is he doing?
What?
-- we're evacuating the building --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
If I can help you ...
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Triplets.
Yes, thanks.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Christ! You do know it all!
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Er ... no.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Bastard!!!
Yes.
Ah.
Don't litter my cab!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Why?
What?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Security.
Turn!
Oh God! What have we done?
Shit! The house is on fire!
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
They're gone.
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
But if they did promote you
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
I did it for you.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Er, yes ...
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
She say she in great pain.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
He's better, though, right?
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
I need to sit down a minute.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Last show of the night.
No.
I'm sorry.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Let's get in a fight, then.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Frank!
Oh no!--I just remembered.
What?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Faster! God!
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
You packing up tonight?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.  That's a promotion!
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
I don't like the word gay.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
A half hour in the lobby.
What happened?
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
What?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
Yes.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Ready.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
We came from Washington.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Yes.  How do you know?
Ernie, they're calling from work.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
You okay?
What happened?
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
That's yes?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Go ahead -- what?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Where's the bathroom?
Tonight.
Oh it's enough...
What!
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Are you ready?
Goodbye.
I like you very much, Walter.
Forget it.
What?
Walter...stay away from me!
Here you go, enjoy.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
Hi Walter...
Maybe so...
Are you alright?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Walter, what are you doing?
What is it, your laundry?
Where'd ya buy that?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
I don't have another cat!
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Well, w-what did you do?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I won't say good luck, Walter.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
You don't have to do anything!
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
If you see him.
I had him in my grasp.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Booo!
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
I'm fine.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Yes.
Which way did she go?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Dying.
Yeah?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
It's the news, Buffy.
I don't understand.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Hi there.
Well, stay here tonight.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
For the dance.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Beverly Center.
Where?
Yeah, whoops I came.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Am I in trouble or something?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Yes.
Ow.
Cramps?
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Here?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
How can you keep doing this?
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
I want to die.
There isn't time.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Pike.
I don't understand.
Got that.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
What happened?
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
They'll kill us!
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Yeah maybe you're right.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The right nostril.  Good.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
What'd he say?
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Aren't we all?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Why you shaking me off?
What do I got?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
I was playing naked.
Boring.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Settle what?
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
That's right.
I'm serious. No interference.
What do you propose?
...stupid things.
Wait, hold on a second.
Yeah.
Hello.
I'll call you right back.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
In other words, I'm fucked.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
You should say so.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
My wife?
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
That's right, yeah.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
No, a...
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
And what'd she want?
Yeah, she's here.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
...and she doesn't always -
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We can't get rid of him?
...pit bosses, floor managers.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Yeah, I know all that.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
It's nice isn't it?
But as much as they loved her...
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Yeah, how do I know?
What? What?!
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Hello.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Right.
It's under...
Yeah.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
To the Riviera.
What did Jennifer have?
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
You fuckin' whore!
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Yeah.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Sam?
Can I go in?
Come on. I'm sorry.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Leave me alone!
I did - I didn't -
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Hey, Frankie.
How are you?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I know.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
He's good. He's fine.
Mm.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Hi, how are you?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
He gives a fuck what I do?
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
Nicky, please...
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost?
Yes.
Well, how 'bout that?
You do?
Lester - he called you here.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Incredible.
Two.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
They're havin' a good time too.
Let's get out of here.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
They'll do it.
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Frankie!
Tony.
You're a little confused?
Denying?
Hi.
The crowd bought it.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Guilty. I am.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
But of course you are.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Hey, Captain God!
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Will you two cut it out?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
You could've killed us.
What's this?
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Any minute.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
You won't disconnect.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
Please.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
What are you doing now?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Hey drop it, okay?
Sometimes I paint.
A price on everything.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
No.
She's gone --
What do you mean?
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
You're going to let them get away with this?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
What's happening?
Why are we stopping?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's a reasonable possibility.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
They saw you kill the driver.
Where do we meet?
Got a phone in that van?
Sure.
I'm here.  Where are you?
Satisfied?
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I still don't see you.
We're waiting on you.
And then?
How far off are you?
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Who were you talking to?
There's no lady here.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Is that good or bad?
So who's he?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You see that, Col?
You fucking promised.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
She's not a tart.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
In a way.
No.
No.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Where?
Why?
Like what?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Jesus Christ!
He lived here with you?
Yes...
Maybe.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
No...
Don't call me that.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
What's her?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
What?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Good-bye, Dil
Got to be somewhere.
More endearments.
Tell me you love me.
Yes.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Horny bastard.
He's hot.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No, what is the thing?
Och, you do, Fergie.
And what if I say no?
Yes?
Dil!
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
What the fuck is this?
Why?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
A hotel?
Hope not.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
No fucking way.
They won't let him die.
Didn't look like that to me...
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
You make a nice couple.
Shouldn't take it personally.
Why?
Who's Dil?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
See if she's all right.
Go to sleep now.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
What if I did?
You didn't?
I never know nothing.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
Oh, come on!
How was I leading you on?
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What?
What's the matter?
Let's look anyway.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
I heard you, I heard you.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
You mean spies and things like that?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Very sweet.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Oh.
Agents.
Who?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Steal it how?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Me? Why me?
No.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Yes.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Does it hurt?
You can't.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Said what?
Who told you to do that?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Maybe.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Who?
Hm?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
What are you doing?
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't know.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voilà what?
Up there! It is up there!
But he is gone.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
How do you know?
How did you find out?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Instant divorce you mean?
Hallo, Peter.
I'm still having trouble with English.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
You mean you and me?
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
What are you talking about?
Don't put yourself out.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
He knows everything.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
What's he up to?
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
No.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
I'm not.
I thought you'd be pleased.
It can't be.
Is Jody still awake?
Hello?
She works at a church?
We just found another body.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
No! That's his table.
Does she fuck?
FINE. Are you?
Mark invited me to the party.
Ok.
Stag?
Twenty eight years ago.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I do not.
I'm making you feel like meat?
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
What are you doing?
I need to ask you something.
Yeah. Who is she?
What?
Where are you going?
Attacked how?
How could you?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
What?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
You're so beautiful.
If sheep don't count.
You're being unfair.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Why don't I--?
What did I say?
I need your truck.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
No.
...doing?!
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
Come on, get in the truck.
We're clear.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
That's...
...fine.
...-damn!
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.

Doesn't work.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
Oh, shit.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!


 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
 Oh...
I know the likeli-...
...wanna give it a try!
You okay?
 Go on.

Come on.
 Aw, shit  
...you're dealin' with!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...here!

See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Not completely, anyway.
Yeah.

Hang...
What the hell?
What the--?

Oh.
Come on.  Come on.
It's working.

 There's gotta be...
Hold this. 
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!

Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Thank you very much.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Yeah.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
And it won't be pleasant. 
But...
...here.   Mason... 
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...including the permanently extreme.
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
They were all wearing hardware.
Doc-...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now listen to me.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
You'll kill us all!
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...and the government.
Mm-hm.
Went away? 
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
...happen if I drop this?
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
This is it.

You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Vaughn.
I wanna patch in from...
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Right.  Tim Mason.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
Where's their protective...
It's a hundred degrees...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
...dangerous.
I don't see my container.
Where's Arlo?
...and unharmed, de-...
Dead, last time I...
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-time,  remember?
 Two pots of coffee...
It's after five...
Go.
Kabula's out.
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
...son.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
...-son.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

...try this one out some-...
...-time. 
Been trying to figure out your secret.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
Mason.
Call an ambulance.
...-m-means, Mason.  

How much longer for the range and power projections?
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...beer.
...to talk, son.
The Army, sealin' us in.
I'll lead 'em out.
 
Get in 

I'll stay here and secure this position.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Thanks.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
How did she get that idea?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No.
My daughter.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
How much are you worth?
Oh, my, yes.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
What are you talking about?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Oh they don't?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Jake, listen.
I've been wanting to meet you.
The apple core?
Who?
What are you doing here?
How do you happen to know her?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
A complete surprise?
What are you having?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
You mean you don't know where you were?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
How did it happen?
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Of course I'm sure.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
They can't be.
I gave everybody the night off.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
...No. Why was it.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
The police?
She's too upset.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
I can't...
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Going somewhere?
No...
...no...
Where can we go?
I'm all right.
I think I got something.
The obituary column?
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Oh, good.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
You're a married man, am I right?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Yeah?... I do?
Sure you do.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
How did they get it away from him?
They were partners.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
How's school?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
Hi, Elena!
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
So what's that got to do with it?
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
He made an awful lot of money.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
That's Leland, isn't it?
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
I know it is, Brad -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
What's the matter with you?
Where's the towel?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Is that what you want to do?
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Was he in love?
That must have been love.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
How did you meet him?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
Well, if it's already too late...
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Dick.
So where is he?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
No.
How like her.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
You're serious. You want to date again.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
He's not invited.
He's your fiancé.
So what are you saying?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Are you open?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Cute cat. What's his name.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
So?
That's what I said.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
No, thanks.
Did you tell Veronica?
You win.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
I guess.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
There's more?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
The milkmaids.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Why not?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Vermont?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
Why'd you apologize?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Why not?
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
An embolism in a pool.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
What, your dick?
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
And this is what you rented?
Five hundred dollars.
You're happy?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
What did she say?
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
Around three or something.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life?
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
Fuck you.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Leave me alone.
Leave her out of this.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Do I know you?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
How much can you bench?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Go open the video store.
A half hour.
With you? I don't think so.
He died in the bathroom.
Veronica.
She's my girlfriend.
Meaning?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Jesus... go ahead.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
At least they weren't lit.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
You're kidding.
What were you doing up so late?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
How do you figure?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
It better be up to and including me.
What the hell was that for?
You're a pig.
Three.
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
Where?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
He gets off on it.
You sucked his dick!
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Really?  You're the best.
Thank you for being rational.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
What're you talking about?
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
I'm not out of shape!
What's this?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
He only speaks Russian?
I do about three-fifty, four.
I beg your pardon!
That's the price, my brother.
And... he told you all of this?
Dental School.
I have first dibs.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Go on, fetch.
The money!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How're ya feeling?
Fine, I guess...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Hello, Gabriel.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
How'd you get up here?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
For the same reason you did, to help.
Let's be creative.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
Nice view, huh?
Never
We don't have time to argue about it!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
Murdering, motherfucker...
What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.
Who's going with you?
Oh, my God!
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Help you.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Helping you, sir?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Aye.
What do I want?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Alexander de Large, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Fucking hell...
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Indeed.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
D'you think we should do something?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Like what?
You need a vacation.
Just had one.
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
In my office?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Something going on?
You guys been holding hands?
What thing?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Yeah?
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Like what?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You're cool.
What?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Don't start.
In case he asks.
You get benefits?
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Slow the hell down!
Max?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Is this your dad?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
How'd you get the picture?
Blue moon...
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Working.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Yes.
This doesn't make sense.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
There's no plug to pull.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
I disagree.
No doubt.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
This... seemed best.
What would you have me say, David?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Dr. Cullers?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
It's beautiful.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Now... you go home.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
And in return?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
I can't do this --
-- I don't know --
I'm not sure it's come to that.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Buck is a deal.
How'd you find me?
That's good: he earned it.
Gotta go, Arletta.
I don't know, Boss.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Hey, Tattoo!
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Lemme see it!
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Like an elephant.
On my own.
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Well, how far didya get?
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
What are you talking about?
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
I want to die.
He was lying.
When was that?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Hello, Daryll Lee.
What book?
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Where are you, Peter?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
I think this is number three...
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
Who's the married man?
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
Are you always so bold?
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I like women like that!
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
So what have we got?
You're damn right I do.
How'd you get in on the deal?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
And her husband? What was he?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
You haven't told me where we're going.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
No.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
What does he want from you?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Just go ahead and tell us.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Maybe.
Please, Letty.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
You did the right thing.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Tell us every detail.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Honestly, Letty.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
What are you looking to read?
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
No.
A daisy for the lady.
What's my rap?
Do you?
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Yeah?
This must be Beast.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Aunt Lily?
Something like that.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
What do you want to do?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Yes, I suppose so.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Oh.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
It's Elvis...
You're there now?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
I assume you want something?
And for my help I would get what?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I thought they came with batteries.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
This is Zero.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Hadley --
What?
I've got a way with people.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
What hotel?
The Holiday Hotel.
There has to be.
What do we do?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
What the hell is he talking about?
No.   How much?
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
The baseball is mine.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
Yeah.
You're not helping.
And how do we do that?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
It's for you.
I didn't have the heart.
I don't care about your sword.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Don't bother.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
What do you think?
I've missed you.
Please.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Mister Funboy.
No.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I can see her.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Don't waste my time.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
I don't think so.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
How do you know I've been with several women?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
It's not really important.
You need help.
Give it up.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's none of your business.
Without question.
Somerset Maugham.
Need any company?
Yes it does.
No.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Because I'm in love with you.
But you knew this was important to me.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Greg McConnell.
I don't think that bothered him.
Are you shitting me?
Outstanding.
I'm in the bath, mom.
What are you scared of?
It was nothing.
Okay.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
I... I don't think you want to know.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
Want to join me?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Who told you?
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Sorry.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
You amaze me.
Shut up.
Nothing.
So? How'd it go last night?
No, tell me.
I want to fuck.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
I thought we should celebrate.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Come again?
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Do you know where she is?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Mommy --
Oh, lots of times.
I got my wish anyway.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
Something's haywire,
Where did you get it?
That's the Farren house.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
What do you want. Amy?
They ran away.
Why didn't you run after them?
Now Amy
And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy!
I'm your friend.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
That one's an elm.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You mustn't be afraid.
But she's dead!
Yes, Amy.
But why?
I wasn't singing to myself.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But she's such a nice lady.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But I only came to give back the ring.
I like stories.
Mommy read it to ne.
And does he kill people?
Hide me? Why?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
Translation: a total geek.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I think she broke the skin.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Hey, did you get contacts?
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Charming Carlton.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Get rid of him!
He's been here all night?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You expecting someone?
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
I thought you and George were getting married.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
I do development for TV movies.
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Frida, you know you're it for me.
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
So pay them back and apologize.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Script coverage?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
No.
No?
You wanna get some coffee?
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Yeah. Maybe.
You didn't say it.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
Your breasts feel larger.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
What about... those guys... I might have...
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Yes... I... we had dinner.
No, it was our first date.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
He tried to kill me!
Please, they'll kill me...
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Iím sorry...
Who is it?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
People...  after me.
Don't know that either.
Which one?
No.  I, ah...
What does she say?  The woman.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Can I get my life back?
You've been working too hard.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
First Lady...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Choices???
Die, you pond scum!
I was a senator, you know.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
And...
Fine.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Oh.  Excuse me.
Just what you think I mean.
Uh-oh...
I'm not sure.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Will he be alright?
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
What?
President vetoes works bill?
Alan...
Perceptual?
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
You got a gun?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
What?
I don't understand.
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I know.
Well I guess...
I can't.
They're crucifying you out there.
I never thought I'd...
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
The Monroe?
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
What is it?
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What?
What is it?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
It's been fired.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
Well...
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Sure.
Who's in?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Are you going with Chet?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
What is that?
Very good, Mr._?
YAWP!
A madman.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Don't stop!
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
But if he said no before then...
From you?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Oh..
Who are you?
He's the owner...
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
And no questions asked.
We were talking about my schedule...
What are you people talking about?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
I don't know where it is!
You're saying they can think?
A meat locker.
It's not them...it's it...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
I don't take orders at all.
So?
Me??
I think he knows that Joey.
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Where are you going?
Maybe plans changed...
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
Damn right!
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
You're full of shit.
Who's full of shit?
They did too!
It's Nick!
I do!!!
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
No.
Get anything?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Where's it gone?
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
What?
Frost.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
I'm just so lonely.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Pow.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
We gotta play with more bullets.
How many bullets?
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
How's Linda?
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Great. Hey. That's great.
Did you get one?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
What the hell's that for?
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I want to ask you a few questions.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Just great.
How do I look?
But Sergeant...
I'll inform dispatch.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You should be in hospital.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
What's it mean?
Yeah.
Bye.  Thanks.
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
No, Stone!
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
You are afraid!
It's mine?
The seventh day of April --
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
I'm through with you.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
How much?
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
We must go on home, Jabez.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
You'll never change -- will you?
I'll never get my washing done.
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
I dunno.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Mary -- Jabez --
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Jabez ...
Just someone from New Hampshire!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
You can talk to me ...
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
How 'bout some Christmas music?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
The code key, please...?
Who are you, then?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Put it down now.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
They would, huh?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
John!
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Yessir.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
You'll be okay.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Don't call yourself fat.
It looks like a whole roast.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
That's it.
I know!
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Who's this?
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
Sonny, be reasonable!
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
It's all we got.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Howard, give him the keys...
I'm sorry.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Why not?
I didn't eat any pizza.
It was on the TV.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
Ah, Jesus...
Where's the money?
We won't have to.
Dead or alive?
Sal?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I don't want him.
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Oh - Maria!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Hello?
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
Is that you, Domino?
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Cunt.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Hello?
Something is going down. Something bad.
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
So?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
Did you ask Sal?
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Good morning.
Gotta go.
Ten.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Fifty cents.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Stop tripping.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Innocent!
Yeah, me too.
D, not C.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Quit bullshitting.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Shit!  I forgot.
Why you gotta curse?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
Ya like him, huh?
Whaddup.  Money?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
I love you, my brother.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Pop, stop lying.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Would you like something to drink?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Who's Principal Collins?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
The second R is silent.
Who's Captain Rob?
Can he do that?
Owww... refreshing.
Who's your partner?
That's a cow, Harry.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Go away, assface.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
You're it.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Well, I'm listening now.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
That's gross.
Yes, what?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
You really are a pirate.
How much homework is there?
Sure.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
You know I do!
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
I think you did it.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
We start our own class?
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
And...?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Everything?
Where is it?
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
My thanks.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
Yes?... How was your journey?
Yes, Sire.
Is this what you seek?
Things have been so serious here lately.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Remove her gag!
Where are we do you think?
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
No.
No.  I don't work here.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
The <u>women</u>?
I never thought of that.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Dracula?
I didn't feel well...
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
You'll be sitting on the right.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Eddie, how was I?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
What do you think you're doin'?!
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Mr. Wood?!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like to think so.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Yes?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
What is happening?
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Is there a script?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Um, I guess --
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Dynamite --
The sun.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
You don't wanna be noticed?
What's uncanny?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Yeah?
They tore her dress! ...
Ed --
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Al!
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Right, right...
Eddie? ...
Yeah?
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Both.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
What?
What are you talking about?
Never would be plenty.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
You batted or you bunted?
Dynamite.
What do you want?!
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
What is?!
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
I'm doing all right.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
What's the dif --
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
Come on, Ma.
What...
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
No.
We don't have foibles.
pierdo.
In love?
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
what?
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
You're kidding, right?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Tracy.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I don't believe you.
Shall we give it a name?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah.
Where 're you going?
These are private -- these are for us.
Who put you up to this?
What do you mean?
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
We talked.
Captain, what do you want?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Of course... But how?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
What?
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
You expecting problems?
You wanted to meet here?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
No.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
What little studio?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I don't have time.  I have --
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Believed what?
Say what?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
No.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
And now you'll provide them.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Really?  What did White say?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
How was I?
When?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Not a word.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Around.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Was it a party?
Working whores with squad two.
Brill?
DePinto's dead.
Turn on CNN.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
I don't know what that means.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
Look, my wife is understandably--
I called my wife!
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
That wasn't so hard.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
Same thing?
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
What if--
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Because my life is being ruined.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
A report?
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I'm not his attorney.
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Not a very good one, but--
Who did you work with to get the--
Sorry.
Well, you know--
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I see her for business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Oh, please--
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I was missing you.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
It is fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Do you like fish?
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
You got a minute?
I know.
Bullshit.
We're screwed.
Any idea what he looks like?
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
Hey!
Robert--
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Where's Stacy?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
I have a family.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
The police?
What's your opinion?
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
You're kidding me.
What about--
What's your ETA?
No thank you.
Which stall?
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
Actually, you sing.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
When were you most happy?
Now.
What do you hate most?
No.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
What?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Right.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Where've you been?
Where did you find that?
She can take you as far as Florence.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
What?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
That's a different dress.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I'll probably marry him.
Why?  Is he staying?
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Never heard of it.
No!
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
Will you come with me?
Why Picton?
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I'll come with you.
This is wonderful!
Kip?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
Why?  Are you German?
No.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
You don't call, you don't write.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Uh. I'm showing off.
How about if I try humility.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I know.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
What about your bags?
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Let's do it again.
Won't take any time.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Terrified. Still am.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Ready?
Yes. Yes.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Oh my god, I thought--
Peoples China Bank.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
You have something in mind?
It was wrong to deceive you.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Four billion dollars.
The sign of our partnership.
Jesus God, it's going through.
Put this on!
But--
You gave them the eight billion.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
This is big enough.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
I figured that out.
Yes it does.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
There's more than one?
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
How does someone get meningitis?
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
The what?
Oh, my God.
Yup.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
So you think we got 'em scared?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
And that's what caused the contamination?
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Uh-huh.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Ho - ly - shit.
Corey.
Right.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Yeah.  A real moron.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Can I play roller hockey?
Annabelle Daniels.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
Great.
You're not nothing, Erin.
You are someone.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
That's Ed.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
You already packed up your stuff?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
You're moving away?  When?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Yes, My Lord.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Howls.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
What is it?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Not you?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
You don't look angry.
What are you afraid of?
I do not!
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I don't like this.
No thanks.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Repairs ...
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What'd you say?
The deflector shields are gone.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
I have followed my feelings.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Will they die?
Did you call the Zoo?
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
With food?
What are they doing here?
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
I tried...
What?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
That's the deal.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Defense against what?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Got a smoke?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Is that what I think it is?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
I'm looking for somebody.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
He can be no other.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Father...
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Very well. Climb up.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
You provoke me, Merlin.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Didn't who tell me?
It's serious?
She is going to be well?
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Convulsion?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Please go away.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
What did you do today?
What kind of stuff?
Where?
You've been playing with it?
Yeah.
Well your thinking's not so good.
All done.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
So what's next?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
What's playing.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Where's Regan?
You'd like that?
You and Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Okay
Dimmy, you worry for something?
And also with you.
Shut up!!
I once did a paper on it
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Sick priest, is that it?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
I've seen it.
Who?
No.
You're not going to drive.
Little slow tonight.
What's this?
So?
Maybe next time.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
What's our friend's problem?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
How's the birthday girl?
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Oh my God ...
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
Lotta water.
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
What do you think?
No?
A gust of wind killed him.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Sure, why not.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
You're getting cold feet about this.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
She'll get here.
Awe inspiring.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Yeah.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Day.  Wednesday.
I thought we had separate rooms.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
How long you been at it?
What the hell are these?
You saw wrong.
A useless talent.
You could've come.
Just until we find another girl.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
What's it for?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Jack, you're on television.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Jack!
Spur of the moment.
You sure?
Sick?  How sick?
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
We're finished.
You're an hour and a half late.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So run a little longer.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
What I mean is --
That!  You can't wear that!
A seven.
I wear a seven.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Uh... good.
I said I was sorry.
Hey!
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Maybe it's legit.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
What'd she sing?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Uh ...
Huh?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Born and bred.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
He doesn't bite.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
No.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
How's egghead?
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
I can keep the beat.
You were good.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Who's Nina?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
So, what happened?
Coffee?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Hi.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
A few blanks?  Like what?
That's not the worst part.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
I'm late for surgery.
How come?
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Get rid of them.
You merciless bastard!
Just following your example.
What's that?
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
You're wearing your suit --
I'll deal with her later.
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Why Jack?
You have kids, Jack?
Jack, are you okay?
Where’s my real dad?
Got it.  Good tip.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
Trouble at work?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
It’s me, Jack...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Jack...don’t even start...
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
What are you doing?
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Hey!  I was watching that!
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
How can you do that?
You had a heart attack?
What...?
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
Jack...can we afford all this?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
Hey, are you okay?
Of course I did.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
We had a tough year.
It's about to be a broken face.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
Then what is it?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Ben did this.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
You <u>were</u>?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Why didn't you say something?
I can...make it work.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
The Other Side got to him.
Brain injury.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Doctor, what's wrong?
But that isn't possible.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
That line was tampered with...
Atomic fuel?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
The Wall's transparent...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
...Is this a fucking joke?
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Can I see your license and registration please?
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
Unguent.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
...Blood has been shed.
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Oh, yah, I know that!
Both of these.
Yah.
White Bear Lake?
Oh sure.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh... A what?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah?
Yeah!
What's the next step here, Jerry?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Mr. Lundegaard?
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, I see.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Good day, sir.
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Okay.
I mean a parking lot.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
How's it look, Marge?
You look in his citation book?
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Well, they're a good outfit.
I'm sorry.
I always liked ya so much...
Nope.
Linda.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Thanks, hon.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
No, no.
Was it reasonable?
They announced it?
Uh-huh.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well -
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
You are?!
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
Sure.
And I saw you practicing this...
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
That's the idea -- we split them.
Like testicular cancer?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I think everything's okay here.
We did make love?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Tyler?
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
It's getting exciting now.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
No, supply oxygen?
Well, uh... great.
There's always that.
Thank you.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
If you could fight any celebrity?
Doesn't matter.
No, I'm not...
You quit?
You know what I mean.
Look...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You... you can't be serious about this.
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
Please...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
You need me.
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
I swear on my life, I won't...
What?
Look at me...
What?
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
You told me you'd say that.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
How'd you know?
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
I... I don't know...
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
You have to tell us now.
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
May we come in?
Take a guess.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Tell me again how it started.
You mean Alex Browning.
I'm not following you --
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
I guess so.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
What on Earth are they doing?
It's only the end of June.
Is that something you're "feeling?"
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
That's what I'm doin'!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Ever do this from a jet?
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Batteries not included.
I've seen worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Gawd, you look awful.
You comin'?
Why me?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
But..How could that happen?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Remember. One chorus and out.
Which ones?
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
<u>What</u>!?
<u>What</u>?!
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
They work for Him.
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
I leave it to you.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Well, id'n that nice.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You said.
Is it my turn again?
You're the pathetic one, not me.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You're depressed that I come along.
What?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
How do you know it's clean?
No. How much do I owe you?
No substitutions.
You want me to hold the chicken.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Yeah... I guess so...
Well...  I better let you...
Tita, I've got to go...
What questions?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Uhm hmm.
Look at that.
But what about me?
That's dangerous, you know.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
You don't call that music, though.
Why?
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
There's some good things on it, though.
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
Then don't go out with me.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Yo.
So watcha doin'?
You know somebody around here?
So you got a girl?
Of course.
I kissed those girls.
Who gives!
They are?
Which one?
Yo, that's my girl.
Where you know Amanda from?
Would you like me to change anything?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Sonofabitch.
You're lucky.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Fletch.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
What the hell are you doing here?
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Funny old bird.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
You're in the Records Room.
That's it.
You may be right.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Wait a second --
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
I'm the Sufi.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Because we can't.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
That's right.
You sure got the hard part.
Will you kill me?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Deal.
Not me.
Cute thing.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Why do you keep doing this?
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Good point.
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
What does all this mean?
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Don't tell me I can't --
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
She moved out.
What did you want under the bed?
Fletch.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who?
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Get out of here.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Frieda's boss.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
You wish.
You okay?
I came to warn you...
Aha, just what I suspected!
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Let's get serious...
Why are all these people after me?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Are you okay?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Who's my real father, man?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Let me go out like a man.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
That's funny, you're cute.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Mr. Doyle.
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
I'm clean.
How's everything?
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
It's beautiful.
What's your story?
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Where's he from?
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Morning.  Sometime.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
How'd I know he had a knife.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Suspicion of what?
You got the warrant?
Same car.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
It was a crematorium.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Baltimore?
It looks open on the other side.
Don't know what's behind it.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
I'm scared.
Hello?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
When?
Chief?!  Is that you?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Are you alright"?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
John, you still there?
John, he's got my driver's license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What?
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
She makes ten.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I look familiar?
You have the right to speak to an att --
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
What're you gonna do?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
What're you doin'?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Maybe we should do some exercise.
What?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
It's deceiving.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
I just want you to like me.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Who's Horace?
Darren, we better turn around.
Is that all you found?
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Jason who?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Why?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Boy scouting.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
I know everything about you, Diana.
I gotta get back to work.
Jesus!
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Does he know about what happened?
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Have you seen Tamara?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
A major prick.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
What's wrong?
Did you hear that?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
What did you do with Rennie??
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
Can't we at least talk about it?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
You have to call the police...
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Press a button and they give us money.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
What do I exude?
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
Is it safe?
You say we go?
No, we're not.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
Let's work on it.
What about her?
Do you want to get some coffee?
She is kicking you out.
What else?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I'd forgotten that.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
I lost it. I lose everything.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
I hate the Mets.
Burnt sienna.
There was a review.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He wears a disguise.
I don't know.
No one's waiting.
Yes.
God gave you ten thumbs.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
That was lucky.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What was he like?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
It was one incident.
Hm.  Is it?
You've done me a great service.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
You mean a general strike?
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
It's over.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
I like football.
How much extra?
Not yet, I'm afraid.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
How often do you test, Director?
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
It needs work.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
Let's get out of here.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
What makes them think that?
You really had other offers?
Not bad, Jerome.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
What do you think?

No bother.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
I envy you, Jerome.
There's a problem, Lamar.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
Hello, McCoy.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
We'll try again.
You okay?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Assumed name... Houston.
What do you want for dinner?
You go out much?
Is he straight?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
I don't want to go there.
You sent me to him.
And switched keys.
He must have.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Where are you going?
No scars?
I don't want to hear it.
Sounds good.
All right. Shells?
Okay. How many bank exits?
Wire pull over?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
How's Mama and the kids?
Drive.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
I got a nurse in mind.
I've got to stop.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What's it got to do with you?
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Why?
Good evening.
Confidential, like.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
She's nothing to do with me.
What was bugging Frank?
What?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
How'd you know where I'd be?
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Who's setting you up in this place?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Then he must have pulled her.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
No. It's all right.
Where you off to?
What happened to you, then?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
What is it?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
I'll call the police.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What about Keith?
You're a bastard.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
You wouldn't.
Do you want breakfast?
Meaning what?
Making a living.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Jack! I didn't like that.
Eh? Have a drink.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
You're bluffing, you bastard!
What's that?
All right. Two hundred.
Deadbeats all.
You did?
They killed the goose.
You're on this...
That's right?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
No.  That's absolutely right.
...that's right...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
He is?
I heard that they were running cold.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
They have...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Should do something to them.
We're just "talking" about it.
No.
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
Is that what I said?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
They stole the phones.
Were the leads...
He said we...
No.
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
...after the thirtieth...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
You know what those leads cost?
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Yes.
...they kicked out.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
How do you know I made it up?
You're so full of shit.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
I've got the check...
You did that?
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
You closed 'em today?
...yes...
No, his wife is.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Three days.
And when was that check cashed?
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
I...
What...?  Say the words.
What are the police doing?
You going to turn State's?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
What if we don't pay?
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Connie.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Is Kay coming?
No.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
The child cannot harm you.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
And you believed that story.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
How long does this go on?
Kay... Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
If you need anything, just...
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Do you gamble?
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
Is he related to the witness?
This committee owes an apology!
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Kay.
How's the baby?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
There are still things I have to do.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
The money was sent.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
It still hurt.  A lot.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
What do I do?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Football in college.
You went to university?
What?
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Is this David's doing?
I don't like to talk about that.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Sorry.  Not today.
Not at the moment.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
No harm done.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Let's get out of this funk hole
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
That only leaves the rest.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I'm very sorry.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
What did you expect?  Bronze?
I don't know.
What was that?
Just take off the fucking mask!
You coming, Boone?
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Who was that at the door?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
I don't mind.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Of course.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
How are you?
How's the leg?
Who was the job for?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
You'll leave -- ?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
Where you been, anyway?
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
Diane 1.
It's all microchips and shit ...
You mean the poor --
Peugot convertible ...
How you doing, man?
Most of 'em are late-model...
There's no one left ...
Have you seen him?
I know...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
You okay -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Yeah -
Dad'd be proud --
Price of doing business...
Too early to tell. Nervous?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
What for -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Buy you a drink?
On account of Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
And here I am...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
So, you seeing anybody?
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I do ... I cut "em...
Wrong preposition...
This time it's for real?
What's that?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Not really -
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
I warned you a million times.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
What're you doing? What about the car?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
What about the schools?
Paulie was just talking about him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Watch this.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Are you okay? What happened?
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Yeah.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Gone.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Okay.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
WILL!
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
I told you, I just got change.
I don't think I...Larry?
Will you take a check?
That's one aspect of what we do.
And what do you see?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
What're those?
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
That's right.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Not at all.
You're here quite a bit, then.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Oh, come on, Sean--
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--I don't have any anger at you--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Why there?
I got one of those too.
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
Like what, Will?
What?
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Nautilus?
Yeah. Do you paint?
No.
Tell me what you really think.
No.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
No.
You've never been on a plane.
Haven't called her.
So Christ, call her up.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Where were you?
That's right.
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
You want to read it?
I know.
That's what you want?
Good for you. Congratulations.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm Will.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
So you just want to use me and go?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
No.
Clearly.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
Joad. Tom Joad.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Say, who runs this place?
Why, you're the preacher!
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Been out travelin' around?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
I aim to.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
Women is always tar'd.
But we can still do it, honey.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Naw--not much!
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Yes, ma'am.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
California.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
That!
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
How about it, Ma?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
Which ones?
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Are you crazy?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Then who *do* we shoot?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Here we go!
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
But what about this?
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
You people looking for work?
We can pick anything.
You do not.
Yes I do.
In the corporate offices.
Computer guy.
Really...? So what?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
Yes.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
What's your business?
You met people.
Bad people.
Hello...?
...Let me get my coat.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
What else? Say more.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
Up on the right.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
I don't think so.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
That's going to cost.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Enough?
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Of course you will.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
So what happened to you?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
What?
He's beautiful.
Enjoy the day.
Need a lift?
It is. It's lovely.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Whatever you want.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
What?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Don't they believe in signs here?
How's everything?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Okay.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
What if she doesn't want to go?
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
I miss you, Annie.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Why do you always wear that hat?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
Don't be such a baby!
You shut up, stupid!
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Hey, darlin'.
Long enough.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Secret Service!
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Shh!
Very impressive.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Cereal.
And what's he do?
Dade?
Up all night again, huh?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
Talk to me.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
And you have to smile.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
A hacker planted the virus.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
What the hell was that all about?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Hello, operator services.
What number please?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Because the lights are all out.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Yes.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Outside.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Like a real sister?
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
I've got you come on, go down.
What are you doing out here alone?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Hell of a night.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
Oh Christ. Doc...
It isn't a man.
Where's that Deputy?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Now you understand?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Why did you hang up on me?
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Yeah.
Jesus!
Sure...
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Sure.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Laurie, you come with us...
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
What does that mean?
Come in, come in.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
And then, uh, April...huh?
Wow, it's the red one?
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
You're joking.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Hmm?
We're actresses.
You're Holly.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Now I ca-can't remember.
When did you first notice this?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
How ya doin', man?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
I'm...all right.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Well, sure.
Oh.
Oh, you-you have that one?
This is not an easy situation.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Lee...
They're fantastic.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Where're you going?
Are you in a bad mood?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Why not?
Are you in love with someone else?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Want some coffee or tea?
...or films you must see or... 
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Jesus...Jesus!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
No.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
I know, I know.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Oooo.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
I was so bored!
Yes, you do recall, right?
I recall you.
I'd never do that.
So how are you?
Really?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
You're okay, though, huh?
Really?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Really?
Just a few minutes ago.
Why are you so upset?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Uh-huh.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
It's a growth business.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
And who is "they?"
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Why did he come back?
Where was the call from.
Somewhere in Italy.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
Yes, I did.
Shut up, Starling...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
I think its meaning is clear.
Said what?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
...long overdue.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
...may be the heat....
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
You want another drink, honey...?
What was it.  What was it, honey?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
...and that is what you need to expand.
...my love...
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
I know it well.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
...would you use a small word?
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because?
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
I think your passion is terrific.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
Do you really not believe in God?
It's not my style, okay?
Gee, thanks.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Oh, I have to hear this.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Veronica, you look like hell.
No way, no day!
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
I don't really like your friends either.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Good plan.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Cool off, we're seniors.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Look who I've found!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
What now?
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
That's coming along well!
Mummy!
Him.
You're such an incredible woman.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Are you a dream too?
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Well?
Really? Do tell.
What did you just say?
What's wrong, Trev?
You're alive...
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
I don't work here.
Hey buddy!
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
How recently?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Mister LaPlante...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
Nothin'.
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
You never saw that picture, huh?
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
I... I know that, John...
You were... very... inspiring.
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
Upset!  What's he upset about?
What?
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Right.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
Have you just plain asked him?
I've asked him what's wrong.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Where'd he go?
Stop knowing me so well.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
How were we -- were we cool?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Did you hear that?
What?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
How long does it have to be a new house?
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I thought we'd be happy here.
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
I think it's time I came home now.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
Must you do that?
What?
Sing.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Leaving what?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
If it came down to it what would you do?
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
Living.  Remember?
That doesn't matter.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Then take me with you.
I remember you.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Because it's my name.
New York is dangerous place.
About what?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
Is it?
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
On the back it has--
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I know.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
The best.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
You won't die if you let me help.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
What hospital?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
What do you want?
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You sure?
Mine, too.
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Kevin left without you.
Are civilians inside?
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Go.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
What's my name?
Is my daddy okay?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Can you get into the office?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you find the disks?
What happened?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
And four children?
Yes we have.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Anything. Strong.
Excuse me, Colonel.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
They fired a rocket at us.
The police are very busy.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Whiskey?
We must go to the Diplomat.
Your police are at the gate?
Where are they going?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
No, sir.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
How so.
What do you mean George?
Satellite feed.
You fucking see that!
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
What do you want?
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Your brother's here?
Thomas wants advice?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
The president has been murdered.
Paul, don't let them die.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Go out! Where?
What?
Why?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
It was substantial.
A Volkswagen.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Oh, my babies.
What are you doing?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
What is this about no water?
Out? Where are you going?
Paul, are you there?
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
Looks like we're it.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Why?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
We can do it...
Or an on-line computer.
This is the best we're gonna do.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
-- the sadistic prick --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
First time for everything.
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
I'm ready now.
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
What're you talking about?
I'll take my chances.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Won't do any good.
And you think it's in there?
Blackburn's dead.
What's the matter?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
What about all my other stuff?
What's he doing daddy?
Are we going back to California daddy?
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
It's just going to take a while.
God rest her soul.
Are you playing tricks on me?
The heater's here.
So what are you saying?
Whoa there...
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
Thank you.
This isn't happening...
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Not on station time.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
How have you ... ?
Sure.  Why?
Wow.  Thank you.
Not quite.
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Really?
You're apologizing?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Eighth room down, babe...
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Oh, you read that.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I was the Warden?
What have you been doing?
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Trust Leonardo....
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Sharp.
The Hudswinger!
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Ol' satchel-butt...
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Oh, no, really, I --
-- or lack thereof?
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
...Certain people are --
...The people look like ants.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Ya know, entry level!
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
...Why, this is worthless.
...It is?
Norville.
Yes sir...
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Well, why don't ya read it.
Not that way! Through the door!
How's that, Sid?
I got gas, Bennie.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
That's nonsense, Alma.
But, Mrs. Rand --
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
I like her already.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
That doesn't sound like him.
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
Have the servants made you comfortable?
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
I don't know -- I don't know--
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Right o'.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
The turkey in?
What's on your mind? Don't --
I'm not.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Hi dad.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
A prior engagement overcame me.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Fascist!
Huh?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- 73
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Who?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I suppose. Why?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Oh.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Social work?
Here you are.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Huh?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Yeah?
Geometry?
I don't know.
Hello, Charles.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
What time is it?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Right.
All my model planes.
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Want a drink?
Vodka?
I don't know. How do I know?
You did your homework, Officer.
How much closer would you say you were?
He would have liked that.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Your friend's all business.
What if someone finds out?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Thought I smelled something.
You're not missing much.
Hey...
What was it?
I suppose.
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Then so was mine...
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
So you have the answers...
If you say so. You are innocent.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
I didn't realise.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
I want more.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
This is no performance.
But if she dies...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
What do you want from me?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I can't do it.
Did I hear a yes?
What have I done?
Where are we?
I don't pretend to know.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
You loved your wife, surely.
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
What can I do for you?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Listen to me. He's here.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
That could break the machine.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
No way.
Yes.
You get any sleep at all?
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
I'm holding your hand!
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Who?
Don't kill me --
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
This was not my idea.
Deep breaths --
You sure it's okay with you?
Pretty cool bar.
Why?
Hello?
You think that's a good place to hide?
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Must have missed the sign.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
Where is everybody?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
Good night, Oliver.
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Hero?
Do you mind if I go with you?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
Listen to what I say --
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Get that ladder up here.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Go through with what?
Oh, no.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Where's Mary?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
What did you stop it for?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Hey, Ernie!
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Of course it's the place.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Daddy!
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Hmmmm . . .
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Oh, George!
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Yes, you bet.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Well, no younger than I was.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
What's that?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
What gives?
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Hello.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Pop!
Pop!
Well, what about all your other friends?
Neither am I.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
I'll take it. And then what?
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Tuesday.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Where's your coat and hat?
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Hey!
On your own time?
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
What about that camera?
Not the drugstore!
I can't let you take her out.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
There is nothing to discuss.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
The whale's mouth?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Sound?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
It's good with coffee.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Nothing.
No.
I know what you're going to say.
Do you?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
What're you doing?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We're alone.
Are you serious?
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Some people.
Hang on!
Terry!  You okay?
Me neither.
Give me back my hat!
What about the others?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Figure they split?
Until we find something.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
What's wrong?
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
You're going out.
What's your plan, Brody?
It's Miller time!
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Well, not much longer to go.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
They're coming with us?
Where's the rubber band?
Are you scared?
Hi, baby.
That we swim.
Yes.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Nobody told me.
I'm sorry.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
We're taking that shark alive!
Why?
I like it when they wake up.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
He's big as a bloody bus!
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Besides that.
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
What?
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
What kind of trouble?
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Like mother, like son....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Then don't come any closer.
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
All he did was kiss me....
A big one....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
All you all right?
I want you to give up your work....
I have to get this finished.
It's just like driving a car....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
You sure you don't need glasses?
They had them on the big one....
I have coffee in the thermos.
You the architect?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Keep it steady....
What happened?
Yeah....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
When I got the grant.....
Hoagie.
I am...You must know something about him....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Shit....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Stop that!
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Jake.
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Yeah?
O.K.
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Where is everyone?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Pay me, and I shut up.
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Why's she blind, Bro?
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
What about Citrine?
Listen, you don't havta come?
What if we need a back up?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I thought it was Taylor's case?
No .. But we have a theory ..
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
You must have some idea about him.
No.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Can I see your hands?
Have you been here long?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
Oh.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Pray?
Ross told me.
You do?
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Who told you?
This can't be happening to me.
No one has ever dumped me.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
No no. I knew.
Wonder what he said.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
It's all going to work.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
We will be fine!
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
You don't have to explain.
Right.  I'll come in.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
It's my fault.
What --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
You want...
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Please, if I start talking --
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Not right now, Jerry.
At last I find you.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Call me tomorrow.
Huh?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
That's your word?
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Oh, tell the story.
To the pools?
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
You'll lose.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
Can you be quiet?
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
He says it's a bad idea!
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
What?
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
That one time was just the bumper.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
You mean it?
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
Where's Dad?
That does sound lucky.
Baryonyx?
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
You remember the sounds they made?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
I want to be an astronaut.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
I have never been on this island!
Well that's good.
Billy!
How did you know?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I don't even know this woman.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
What kind of gun is that?
How close do you have to be?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Where's Kelly?
I have to find Kelly!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Oh, God.
So what's your story, Nick?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Give it more morphine!
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
There you are.  Out you come.
Why?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
The movement!
Constantly sick.
- - like birds - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
Dr. Grant!
Why not?
Alan?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
- - shut up.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
I read your book.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
I doubt it.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Go, go, go, jump!
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Why did you do this?
What?
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
What happened?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
How do we prove it?
Cute waitresses?
Uh-huh...
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
And if he's not?
We're down to seven minutes.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Success or nothing?
A man must eat --  And drink.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
An empty tomb?
-- You appreciate my writing.
Another one?
A true friend would do it.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I did not realize it was obligatory.
-- Eduard --
I do.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
I've never seen you here before.
Tonight?
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
I've heard of it happening.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
No -- not this time.
-- Listen to me --
Eight -- and seven months.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
Do you?
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
What's the matter?
It's gone out so quickly?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
You look tired.
Amerika for us!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
He's grubbing for money, father.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I can't imagine you crying.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
It must have been terrifying?
Coz of something I lost.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
I do not love him.
You think people hate you.
Didn't want you.
Well I have to close up now.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Like for you to look for the man.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Mm.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
What? This?
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
What're you gonna do next?
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
What?
I was wondering what that was.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
OK.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Then, close the case.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Not unusual.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
I think she's trying that.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Think this is our guy?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
What do you like best about your daddy?
Playing.
In real life when does he hit you?
On earth.
Mom, I mean dad?
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Is mom ever coming back?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Why does he decide?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
Sustained.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Objection.
Objection!
So do I.
Eight, almost nine years.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
No.
Is that...permanent?
I...I don't know...
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
How long was that?
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
You've been living here, in the city?
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
How should I know?
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Right.
And?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Oh, no..
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
No, but--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Things? What kind of things?
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
You ever think about getting married again?
What?
Uh, huh...
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Ted, I just heard...
Kham, Holiness.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
I am afraid.
Yes.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Do I have money?
How big is Tibet's army?
Will we be in this war?
Ask whatever you will.
Can India help us?
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
But you will always be here?
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
You will not come?
Am I running away?
We cannot.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Like my mother.
You're a beautiful woman.
Why are we landing?
Around here.  Yeah.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
His head was just... bitten off.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
No.
What?
Guess I finally got bit.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
How big do the bears get?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Baby crocs?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Okay.  We're up at six.
He thinks they're what?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
No thanks.
Really--
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Alright, Jack!
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Watch out!!
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
You said nobody came in here!
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
I'll take it!
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
Hank?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
No. He won't come after me.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Was it a butterfly?
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
He did?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Maybe...
My letter...
What?
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
My God, Alice.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No.
Ottawa!
Will you men help us stop the French?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Qui vive?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
He did.
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
That's an order!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
We're on backup air.
Where's Doc?!
What about our quota?
Oh, God, she's out there...
Twenty minutes...
How do you feel, DeJesus?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
What happened?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
The infirmary?...
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
No fuckin' lie...
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Well, talk.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
Like antiques.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
You all right back there, mate?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
What can I do for you?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
That's it all done, we are off.
Why, what's up?
You and me, Tom.
Tom?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
I'll see ya.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
You jerk--
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
They stole our land--
You think I can't learn that?
And what did she do?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Well?
Out of the Army?
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
Charley Wade.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
That's not the point.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
You still going to all the home games?
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You look good--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
No sir.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Dad--?
Something like that.
It's a lead mine.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
It's a .45.
Yeah?
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
And people make their choice--
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Senora Cruz?
'57, 1 believe--
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
He still living?
And Buddy was one of them.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
And my father?
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Field trip?
Most people did, yeah.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
How come it feels the same?
What was your father's name?
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
You sell much out here?
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
No--
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
Payne.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
Who?
D'Amour.
Right.
Right.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Please.
Yes...
Yes.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
I'm no bodyguard.
When do you want me to start?
Are they treating you okay?
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
It was more than that, I think.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Yes.
Don't look.
Bad show last night?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
Trickery and divinity.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
Mine.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
I don't think the dead much care.
A ticket home,
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
The Puritan?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
And you believed him?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
Call me tomorrow.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
And he's dead?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Two years.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Charlotte, who?
Hans was very attentive to you.
Oh.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
It's bad isn't it?
We should get you to the doctor.
You think so?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Yes?
Is there anything I can do?
Like Japanese food.
Ok.
Evelyn Waugh?
See you later.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
It's amazing  there!
You never said anything to me...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
He spoke to you?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Two negatives always make a positive.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
What's that got to do with you?
I had to.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
So what?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
We need all the help we can get.
He can see you Thursday.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Ah, Mom.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Taste this.
Yeah, you met her?
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Which one for tomorrow?
That was nice.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
It's okay.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
I told him you looked like me.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
You were trying to make me look bad.
How's that been?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I want to ride my own bike.
What?
Way to hoop.
I know this.  What do you want?
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Guess not.
You finish the reading for E-con?
What?
It's okay, little baby.
Give me the ball.
I won.
You're not stupid.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Quincy...
The "man" again.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Can we talk?
You forgot to be there.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Just something I'm trying.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Oh yeah?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
What do you mean?
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Maybe go back to school.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Then why are you so upset?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
You work too hard, Pop.
What people?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
What?
Tell me what?
Lucky kid.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
You ok?
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Does this sound weird?
Oh that's good.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
...Hello...?
For what?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
ok.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
Ok, ok. I'm back.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Please, yes.
No.
Yeah.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Let's make a deal.
I lost my gun.
What?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
I'm sorry --
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Yes.
It's upstairs.
Can you hold it?
What happend, what's going on?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
It's ok --
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
No.
I was listening --
What's up?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
That's right.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Braces?
Yes I do.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
He has Phil right now.
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
No.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's all important --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
She's retired.
Psychology major?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Is Linda here?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
When did he go off chemo?
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Marcie.
What the hell is this Marcie?
Will you say my name?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I won't.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I can't fuckin' do this.
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
...say it, Jimmy...
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Jimmy, did you touch her?
Hello?
You're her boyfriend?
Can I come in?
Do you still have to do homework?
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Linda --
Hang up the phone.
Hello.
mmmhmm.
Phone number.
yeah.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Be ready at two --
I'm fine. nothing.
Hi.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
No, M'lady.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Tomorrow.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
Hang himself?!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Aramis, this will never --
So what has changed?
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
What do we do now?
Do I look all right?
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Where are you going?
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
The King killed my son!
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
A personal nature?
Silence!  I order you!
Continue.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
Sire, I --
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I'll take the south end -
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Alright, where is she?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Who is it?
Mind if I turn out the light?
No.
Why did you set me up?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
For Christ's sake, why?
The mark? Yes.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Who is it?
Get me a plane!
It's getting late and...
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
What's being photographed?
In eight days.
Yes, are you okay...?!
You'll come by?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.
You will tell the truth?
Come in.
Yes?
Linda King's desk.
She'll be in, in the morning...
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
I don't understand.
Do you know something about that?
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
What's average?
What the hell can I do?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Blue, then.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Yes. Is Molly there?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
I figured I'd ask you...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
What were the yards like?
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
May I keep the file?
I haven't decided yet.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But wasn't it funny?
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Hi...
Hi...
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You're a wimp.
Give me the book.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Positive.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Then the informant is real.
He'll be contacting us again.
You're two hours late.
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
Do you?
Did you hear that?
... yes.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
How long?
The cubicle across from you is empty.
But what if...?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
This can't be...
... am I dead?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Did you believe in them too?
How is he?
How...?!
Hello?
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
You're the Oracle?
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
Gee-zus.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
What happened?  What did you see?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
Go!
Is Morpheus alive?
You don't have...
We need an exit!
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
Who's the girl?
She don't look Jewish.
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Where to?
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
Let's get out of here.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Don't be smart.
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Disgraceful.
Where's the rest?
Diane, how are you feeling?
I know.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Well, maybe you missed something?
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Come on.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Daddy!
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
-- Black.
Oh, the goddam party --
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Yeah, but --
But what?
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Thank you.
It doesn't matter.
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
Sounds good.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
'Joe...'
Is there any more to it?
What do you mean?
Shall we adjourn?
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Yours.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
But I didn't mean to do it!
Make it go 'way.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Not time yet.
Yah.
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
What?
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
I didn't know that.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Love.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I've got plenty of friends.
I appreciate you --
I am, too.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
I loved it.
Susan --
-- Yes?
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
No.
When you go, I go.
Yes?
What do you mean?
Yes.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Are you going to eat your lunch
Excellent.  What is it?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I guess...
About Susan?
Hello, Bill.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
You are?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Then what is it?
So that's what love is?
An offense --
Death!
You want me to be your guide --?
I think you know --
Watch it!
I'm sorry --
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Yeah, I give a shit.
This one.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Drew's aboard?
How did you know?
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
Don't get carried away.
You're not listening --
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Why not?
Well, what then?
Should I wear it?
I'm sorry... um... ?
So you're holding my calls?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Where'd you get it?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Is that what your little note says?
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Why?
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Such as?
Why would you do that?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
How?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
On the house.
Thank you.
You've read it a hundred times.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
You don't know him?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
What's wrong with this one?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Yes, I will.
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
You probably.							 *
Your name's Teddy.
What was it for?							   *
He any good?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
How many?
Two main players plus three.
25% discount on the load.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
How's he not your husband?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
No.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Good samba dancing...?
Zero risk.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Do I need it?
If they attack you...
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Yeah?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
What's our deal?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
On the phone.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
So?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
That sonofabitch!
Alonzo...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Forget it.
What's in your socks?
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
You got a comb?
They wrong?
I read it.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
Instant V-goddam-D.
...He had a bald skull and...
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
How's your hernia?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Shit.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
...are you with the Consulate?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
What they give you?
How much did you have?
Get the... midnight... express.
Where is it?
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
I think I've been poisoned.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Its muscles are locked.
A mistake.
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you doing down here?
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Oh, no, you were-
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
What-
It worked before...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
What?
Oh, my!
I'm not much of a critic.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Here.
What are they...?
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I don't have a title yet.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
I'm getting to believe you.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
You want me to burn my book?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
I'm telling you, I can't.
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
...have to wait.
Have to wait.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Well, it certainly says you.
Annie, what is it?
No, I haven't.
What things?
You don't know?
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
He's your client, huh?
So do I...
Buster.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
That'd be a first.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
I suppose I did.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Not exactly.  Wallis?
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Before we kill her or cure her..
We're due to take off.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Do you know me?
What if I pay the rent?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
I wouldn't do that.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Listen to what?
What's you name?
Ethan Hunt.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
I don't.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Have you met them?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
An idea, yeah.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
Twice.
Excuse me?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
I do.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Luther, say again.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
Satisfied?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Okay...
Whoís dead?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
What?
Kittridge.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
What sector's the air conditioning?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Higher.  Higher.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Sure.  If the main character does.
Abort.  Thatís an order.
You got it.
And get a doctor.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
That's what we do isn't it?
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Thirty-two and change.
Yes.
I'm getting married.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
I got it done.
You're married.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
He's in Palermo.
Maybe I should come back another time.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
No.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Stop it!
Loretta.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
That light.
Oh my God.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
What did I do?
Why not?
It's really cold.
You're making me feel guilty again.
He's coming.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
I like this ring.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Where you been?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Are you drunk?
What? He's in Sicily!
She recovered.
Alright.
He should pay.
I don't know.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Do you have a girlfriend?
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
You mean the whole house?
Oh.
You were a tiger last night.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Burn her anyway.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Where did you get the coconuts?
Who are the Britons?
Oh!
A what?
One that looks nice.
Yes ...
What is that?
Oh, please!
What word?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What, "is"?
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
I've had worse.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I'll do you for that.
You'll what ... ?
I'm invincible!
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Nu!
There!  Look!
A G...g...g...
Be quiet!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
... Well, we did do the nose.
Make a bridge out of her.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
To find the Holy Grail.
I can't.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
Did you kill all those guards?
Rather what?
But, Father.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Yes ...  make sure ...
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Seventy a year.
Sixty.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
She loved him.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
And she sent no word down?
She'll get over it.
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Checked and locked, sir.
I need a man who knows where I am.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
Go inside at once.
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
For Her Majesty.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Mr Brown.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
That doesn't make him an expert.
Must they always follow us?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I was told you were in a fight.
Ma'am?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
I'm breaking no promises!
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
Yes.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Why?
We were expecting you to return by six.
What is it?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
What do you mean?
How the hell did you do that?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
What's the question mark?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
How'd you know it was us?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
I have to talk to you.
What do you mean by "weird"?
No way.
Where to now?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Put in a quarter.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Which way?
Is that your question?
That's impossible.
What's going on, Cynthia?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Someone's shut off my money!
The Cowboy??
No problem. What's on your mind?
What did I say?
Okay, I'm thinking.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
No, I don't.
Wow!
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Are you okay?
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
What?
Yes, there was.
Number 17.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
I don't know who I am.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
What do you mean?
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
"So... surprise"...
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
I just wanted to come here.
Yeah, they showed me
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Find out who they are?
Palmdale.
Good morning. What do you have today ?
What's going on ?
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
It's fine thanks.
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
When I think you're ready.
So ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
John, sir.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
What did you hear ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
What is Bruce doing ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Look he figured it out !
Thank you very much.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
What an incredible view !
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Shut up ! It's me.
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Why don't you shut up now.
Good morning.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
I don't think you're very polite.
Don't mention it.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
Visualize a spare?
Seriously.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
I already bought a ticket.
Hi Dad.
Yeah.
She just had a baby that's all.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
You are?
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Come on in!
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
Is it okay if I drink this?
I guess you have.
Vada?
But we made a business deal.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
Don't wake up Vada.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Vada.
Change my name.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
...I dropped it.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Lock the door.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Oh...what's that?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
So what's wrong?
Good morning.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
They're enormous, I know.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Why not now?
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
He's a great poet.
Do you know him?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
You're such a baby.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
What?
The boss is watching us...
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
Well the other night at dinner...
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
This is where we are.
Goodnight Shelly.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
I know that, but what do you want from me?
When?
I like the freak show.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Oh come on.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Hi, is Vada home?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Will you tell her I came by?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
He likes her.
Maybe black means you're happy?
No, I'm divorced.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I will I promise.
It's a mosquito bite.
What?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
You're right, let's knock it down.
Run faster they're after us!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Come on, let's go.
Well, let's spit on it.
What?
I should look different.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Stay, huh?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
We'll never be the same.
Impressive.
The man you love.
Ben Gay.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Well, we're...
Excuse me?
But he sure can kiss.
Let me rephrase that...
I was gonna predict that.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
And you think he's kept this to himself.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Waiter! Check, please!
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Where did we first hear th...
Will she like it?
Michael...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Why would she come here...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
What?
Hi! Star.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
They can come to the concert in the park.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Bastard
She's in Paris.
You bet.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Did you see who that was?
Uh huh.
Replacement party.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
I don't think so.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
How long have you been with them?
Do you ever do any writing?
I'm here.
Who is this?
I'm not sure. Where?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Well...How have you been?
Hello.
That's unkind.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
What?
Sorry I'm late.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Hi.
He ain't really new.
Southern California.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Ryan O'Neal.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
What did you think then?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Thank you, sir.
Susanville, Soledade.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
I see.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Not good.
You ready, Donut?
She sings? What does she sing?
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Sure.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Out front.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
I admire them.
Just for fun, I guess.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Take a wild stab!
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
How 'bout Mallory?
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Don't call my men assholes.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
Boy - you hear me?!
I said: Cut it out!
Okay.
Well, he worked around.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
How about another beer?
Let's go, Duff.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
'Been up north?
Goin' to see my kid.
Surprised?
How about it?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Is that so?
What's wrong?
You know how to box?
Uh-huh. Why?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
They won't.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
How about a drink?
Couldn't get the words out before.
No, thanks.
What did you say, boy?!
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Sure.
No, they won't.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I doubt it.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Come on, Will.
No. Why?
What's the matter now?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Since when?
How long's it been?
We got any shots?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What the hell is that?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
What about McCoy?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
You've got your orders.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Right...
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
It'll flatline your ass.
How's the ice?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
What is it?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
You've been calling her name.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Case... Are you alright?
Shit...
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
YOU DID.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Bridgework?
What is this?
Hidden camera.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
A--flack jacket.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
He's my teacher!
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Better person than I.
See!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I-
Whoa. Deja Vu.
So what are you thinking for college?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Please. Please don't walk away.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
You ruined the whole thing!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
I can't help it.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Oh, please...
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
I'll kill you now.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
So, you live around here.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
What is this place?
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
What's that?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
I gotta stay up, Max.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Didn't get much sleep.
Just until we get things under control.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Remember -- open mind.
How do we get in?
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
I could've saved them.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
How is he?
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
I won't allow it.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Really, no.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Okay -- fine.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Floppy, huh?
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Let's go in.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Oh please sod off.
That's not true.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Miracles do happen.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
In a depressingly asexual way.
Bernie.
Hello, Bernie.
Shame!
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Is this your first film?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
Can I help you?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I wouldn't go outside.
What's going on?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
God Bless America.
I second the motion!
Yeah, Mack?
Where ya goin', Mac?
There they are!
It's the questions she asks.
Lobotomy?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
So why are you talking to him?
What for?
Just wait till you hear...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Is that so?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Yeah!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Oh yeah...
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
What are these men doing up wandering around?
What?
That!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Is he in an asylum?
Oh, yeah...
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
You're sure...
What's mezzaluna?
Hm.
Who's this?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Why can't you just tell me?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Mickey Spillane?
So.  You found him.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
Wait.
Yes?
Sure.
Faith, this is my mother.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Have you seen him with someone?
No...  I can just tell.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
I just got a dial tone--
A phone message.  Only--
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Larry bought himself cologne?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Because I'm the one who's single.
That was really sweet...
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
What about Peter?...
Who said I was going?
Peter found him?
Amazing...
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
And Larry?...
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Right.
What?  You know him?
And you didn't tell her?
Where is she?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
I'm gonna take her home first.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Then don't.
Mm—hmmm.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Hello, Edie.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
I think we're O.K.
How would you've done it?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
You haven't finished your beer.
You're not sore at me?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I don't rate it.
Told him what?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Such as what?
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
Give me a double.
Terry?  What do you want?
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
You ratted on us, Terry.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
It frightens me.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
I'm not sure...
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
What can we do against them?
Well?
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
You may take her now.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
He didn't want me to.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
You did work for Emil, right?
Where in the hell are we?
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Sure looks that way.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Whatta you think?
Outside of that.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You find out?
I get that feeling, yeah.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Shut up.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Who?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
I thought so, too.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Faye Dunaway.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
You like taking risks.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
You believe that?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Whose blood you got all over you?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Meaning time came, I left.
Like what?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Gee, I wonder why not.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You're not my type.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Then they're not separated, are they?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
I don't have any idea.
Thank you...
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
I think he must've fell in.
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
Red...Strange?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Land of the free...
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
I was grieving too.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
Get me into a plane!
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Danny...
I can't make it.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
What's your name?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
It must of been a convincing letter.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Charlie really has a great voice.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
You got a Tab?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Great, isn't it?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
He's trying.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
But what has to be different?
That's real big of you.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
What?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Hello, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
It was Beth's idea.
Coffee and a donut.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Is that one of your poems?
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
You think so?
Thank God for that.
This morning was good.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
I have a note.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Who was that man?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Why not? They're my favorite.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
What's that?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
What are you talking about?
What do you know about hypnosis?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What do they do up there?
So where're we going?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
Yes!
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
What was the file name?
Thanks, Walter.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
Jerk... What did you say?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
What's her name?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Get it?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Particularly, Charles.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Rach.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Really?
Hello?
I'm fine.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Leave that.
Get real.
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Lots.
Who?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
What whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Why, what'd you hear?
We can, can't we? Trust you?
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
What about her?
What, you're afraid?
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Can we switch?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Little ratty-ass.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
For your own fear.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
New Mecca....
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
"God is Great," yes?
King Tut's tomb....
What the hell are these?
Very big beads.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
What's her name, anyway?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Not a star-jumper.
What, it's broken?
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
What's so special about him?
The blood transfusion.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
It's no use ... there she goes.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
No cigar.
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Lucius.
I told you not to bring the other one.
What is that?
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Read it yourself.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Taylor, please --
...but 'Lias is still out there.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
Sarge?
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
I got one...
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
No, thanks...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
You volunteered for this shit man?
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
These two holes are yours...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I haven't been invited.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good evening, Miss.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
Much too late.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
How did you meet him?
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
You tried to run away.
There wasn't any plane.
Bad enough.
So have I.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
I think you mean that.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
That's an evasion and you know it.
You were there when I last saw him.
You understand perfectly.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
For two hundred?
Got it on you?
Round of golf Saturday?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
That must hurt.
The only answer I have for you.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Information.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Mr. Mitchell.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
That's not enough.
Got a moment, Inspector?
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Do I know who lives down there?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh nothing.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
Who's the girl?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
What a shame.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
It's terribly good.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
Good.
Are you going to have coffee?
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Might?
Let me see.
Mmm...
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Okay, I will.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Now listen...
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
Oh no!
One shot stopping.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
We gonna jump or jerk off?
I can't do this.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Three seconds... two... one...
Fine.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
What do you want?
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What's goin' on?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Why us?
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Where the hell is his body?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Your uncle will like this.
There's no way you could know that.
No.
Yes.
You looking' for some company?
Stolen?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Get in.  This side.
Diet coke.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No?  Why's that?
I sell them.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Any good?
You're upset, huh?
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Good.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
He's good at what he does.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
What's that?
You won't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
But don't they have it in English?
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Right.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Did I wake you?
Why?
You broke my nose.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Looks slow tonight.
Yeah.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Dummy.
Go for the bucks.
You sure you won't come with me?
You're a guest here?
What's your name?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Me?
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Who are you?
With pride. What can I do for you?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Gently.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
It never happened.
You're quick.
Why is that, do you think?
Why should that make such a difference?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
I thought I was going faster.
What do I do?
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- wait, just wait --
-- well, when does it get good?
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
What? What?
Yellin.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
No --
-- yes --
-- anything you want --
Hah?
He's dead. He can't talk.
Humiliations galore!
Sorry.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Get used to disappointment.
You're sure nobody's following us?
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
You're that smart?
Morons.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Yes sir.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
But that's cheating!
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
But what if the play was a hit?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Where would you like to eat?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
You found a flop!
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Maybe it's not true!
I never should have listened to you.
What???
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
No kidding?
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
What?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
How early?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
I live there. Alone.
If she paid you well?
No. I told you, she's confined...
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Yes.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
I still feel...
With you.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Stay here.
In a hurry.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I have?
Except you.
To a private island, like you?
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Thank you, Norman.
Phoenix?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
In quite a hurry.
Wait a minute!
Why?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Looking for me?
Satisfied with your cabin?
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Do what?
Shut up!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Then you knew of the inheritance?
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Did you hear?
The child!
Yes.
There's no child here.
Did you? Where?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't agree with you.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Thank you.
What! What are you talking about?
Are you giving me this straight?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
No kiddin'?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Call the Homicide Squad!
No kiddin'.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
What do you mean police dog?
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
That's what I said.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
You go in for dangerous things.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
Heaven knows. A lot.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Shall we unpack it?
I'd know him anywhere.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Dysfunctional --
Nobody.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
What'd you do, Rose?
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Well, some fiend might.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Here comes Daddy.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Daddy, what's the matter?
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I am ahead of you.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I think we both know her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
What time is it?
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
What did you forget?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Took your time gettin' here.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
I was going to tell him.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
I need the "when" and the "where."
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Sons of bitches!
Yeah.
They shot us all, kid.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
Follow me.
Where we going?
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
There probably is.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
It's our job.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You need a doctor.
What the hell's his problem?
We're screwed.
Why the beach?
This shit was Ming.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
I have felt him, my Master.
Vader's on that ship.
Lower it!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Good luck.
What did he say?
Come on! Come on!
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Then you know why I have to face him.
I know, father.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Yes.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Right!
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Hello.
What a guy
Goodbye
Was all I had to say
No no no no.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...How's the turtle food this week?
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
I think he might be worried.
It's only temporary.
Would ya take off your glasses?
Do me another favor?
Don't want weak legs.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...I dunno.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
...Like you?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Paulie!
Don't talk like that to him!
...Paulie. Stop now!
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Get that doctor.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
I don't like ya face.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
That's ten bucks.
What's happenin' here?
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
A hundred an' thirty.
How'd you know?
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Here's the card?
How do you mean?
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Bullmastiff.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Hey --
Don't get mental, man.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
...People talk to me more.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
So where is it then?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
They must've taken it off me.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
How did you get onto Doom?
Now what?
What's with the dip?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Young Romeo is it?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
My poverty, but not my will consents.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
I take thee at thy word.
Ahhh!
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Is she a Capulet?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
What in bloody hell is going on?
Hazard pay...
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Do you have the material?
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
How so?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
I didn't expect that he would.
You should learn a little patience.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Know what?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Not exactly.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
They don't have the package.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
That's a good question.
Why's that?
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
My man, how you doing?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Never heard of it.
No.  We can't.
Why?
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
What makes you so sure?
I...I can't do that.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
It's gonna be o.k.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
What for?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
Great...
I don't know.  My friends...
What did he buy?
What do you think about all this?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
Well I don't know --
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Invitation, please.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Oh, you American?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
I have plenty of dates.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
How do you know he's our man?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
I don't want to hear this.
Get it out of here!
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
No you didn't!
Is this a payoff?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Are you okay?
Any leads?
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Feds asked for me?
And that, of course, would be me.
Tell me about it.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
That silly-ass look on your face.
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Good God, ya'll!
Which one?
No, please, I don't --
What's wrong with that?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
Hello.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Right.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Fisher, let him talk.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
Okay, we'll order out.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
How romantic.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Kind of isolated.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Lost!
I'd rather not.
You were not.
You're a goddess!
It's probably because you got him fired.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
I love you.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
It's delicious, trust me.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Right.
No.
I know.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
So I mailed your letter.
You're going to miss the train.
No, I know that part --
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
What?
Magic.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
No.
It is not --
You think so?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
What?!
So I can go.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
It's a sign.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
I can't believe you flew first class.
I thought you were never going to call me.
Oh.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
The woman question?
Why are they singing, Mama?
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I'm a fool.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
Tell me.
Ramón -- you can't.
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
No ...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
No.
Bobby?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Who wouldn't?
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
What?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Fuck you.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Never heard of him.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
What do you want from me, Colette?
It gets me through the day.
How much time do you have?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Who is it?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
I think on account of his nose.
You want a hit?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Yes, Jimmy.
But...I've seen you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
If you say so.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
You think I'm a Judas?
Thanks for not judging me.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
I was getting to it.
Question is, what are you doing here?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
No kiddin'?
A half-track, anything.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Upham?
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Worked, didn't it?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
Nope.
Bits and pieces.
You're welcome, John.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Sure, Reiben.
Huh?
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Maybe Caen.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Here they come.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
Twenty-four-five.
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Speak with my lawyer.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Gee, it's easy.
What's a scam?
Lloyd.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
You like it?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
They really applauded you today honey.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I won?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
I'm fine.
Lloyd?
Did he ever get rough with you?
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Honey!
Swear to god.
But I found the money.
You think you know what this money is?
No, but you stole from them.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yeah.
Are you busy on Friday?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
So what's your job this summer?
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Me?  Sure I do.
Come on.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.
It was wonderful.
Well, I need to study, and...
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Okay, what did we just decide?
We decided...
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
I'm sorry.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Oh boy.
What?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Later for you, Luke.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
You know what, you'd like her.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
What do I got for you?
Pistols?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Pots and pans.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Yes.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
Eight hundred, give or take.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
You're sure about this two person thing?
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Hang up...call...
Hello? Ted?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
It helped me realize one thing.
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Where's Sid?
I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Or it found us.
Just for you, Sid.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Meaning?
Can we turn the light on?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Yeah, right.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
No, wait...
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
She's not here right now.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Take it off.
I get scared really easy, okay.
What was that?
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Do I?
Thanks.
Nope.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
Four? There are five.
Did you request this case?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
What Rielly?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Where's Gale?
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Always.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
You're not a detective.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Thank you.
Your life?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
What the hell are you doing?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Possibly.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Who's this?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Who the fuck is this?
I didn't kill anybody.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Ready?
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
It's been a year since she died.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
I wanna let go. I do...
Hello?
Who is this?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
What do you want?
To talk.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I'm getting scared.
I wanna play a game.
NOOOO....
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
What brings you out to these parts?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I'll call for backup.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
She's tough.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Jesus...
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
I'll look for it.
Just stay back.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Uh-huh.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
What's Leatherface doing here?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Wanna another beer?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Do you believe this shit?
No way.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Take a message.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
That's mature.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Announcing what?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what?  This victim...
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
What time is it?
You didn't know.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
I... I don't follow.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Drop it.
You think it was poison?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
What?
He just may be nuts enough.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Sorry about that... I just...
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
No.
And so what?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
We need a warrant.
Oh, you want to stay now?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Stay with him.
Don't do this... please...
I want to have children.  It's just...
How's California?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
It was, I tell you!
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
You ain't goin'...
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Unnt-meah!
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Good night...Laurie...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Not no more.
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
You crazy?
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
I'll do it myself.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
So do I, believe me.
Martin, it's not funny!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
No, I've never seen him before.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Mrs. Straub!
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Hammer?
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Tenth floor.
You did not like the speech?
Ned…I know…I know
Oh…what have I done?
Thank you, my lady!
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Nothing comes.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
Put his feet in.
Cut his nose off.
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
What happened to Sam?
It is all locked safe in here
Now where? Will?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
I did not.
Burbage says you have a play.
The daughter of his enemy.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Not ready? Where is she?
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Ay me."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
My lady!
Can you love a fool?
I do not know how to undress a man.
Even your play.
Moonlight!
That's my line!
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
You never spoke so well of him.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
My lady Viola.
But why me?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
He is dead?
Wait there.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Is there a man?
All right, just a few questions.
In the same fashion as chess.
I don't have time.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
No.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
What's the problem?
I want to talk now.
Now.
Security.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Is this being recorded?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Just one thing.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes.
For the flat.
So we'll meet him, then?
Aroused and inflamed.
Alex.
I'm not usually drunk.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
The man we know and love.
I think you're lying.
Hugo.
Did what?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
We have to talk.
David?
We could put it somewhere.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Alex.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
I see.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
Would you like to talk about it?
That's what it cost, David.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No one.
What guy that died?
You must be Juliet.
What do you do?
What's it about?
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
We cannot go into this later.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
She's got a...
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
Why don't you see Lester?
I hope she's all right.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
You going to answer it?
Are you?
Then it's not your problem.
Okay.
Shit.
No thanks.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
I never get my hair done.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Then what do you think?
I am not!
Right now?
Great.
What sort of references do you have?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Probably the bathroom.
Well, what do you think?
No.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
What are you talking about?
That sounds like me.
He still having parties?
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Why?
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
I don't know... Jackie?
Yeah?...
What with?
Otis is dead.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Well, like what?
George --
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
What about me?
You're different.
Honey?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Whether or not I'm going.
No, but I think they might.
When is that?
Who?
Obviously.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
Did you?
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Well, yeah.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
You're right.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Oh, hey...
Layered?
What do they look like?...
No thanks.
Me!
What took you so long?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
You do?
Yes.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Hi, Leonard.
Who is that?
I know, I'm sorry.
-- No. No really.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
We don't think marriage is important.
Well, you know what I mean.
I'm exaggerating.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
That's right.
Is he an enemy?
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
I don't think so.
That bastard.
Thank you.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Are you having a good time?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Yes?
Are you sure?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Who?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Stop swinging the bat.
Mr. Ullman?
Have any trouble finding us?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Royalty?
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Thanks.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
What's the money for?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
What kind of noises?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Sure.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
You want to know what I think?
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
But Uncle Al! You said-
Oh?
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
But I'm fearful!
And you listen to that?
His ashes?
Good evening, Vincent.
Oh my! 
Chops?
Two days.  An hour or so.
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Like this place?
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
I... I brought you something.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Very well.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You mean black people?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It never solves anything.
What?
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
You're not... seeing anybody?
Hey, girls.
Then one day they find you.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
You didn't shoot!
What's she doing?
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
He's decent.
It's better than ice cream.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Excuse me?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
Bring him.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Very few, if any.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
The Widow Windsor.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
What is the common thread between these victims?
What kind of nuts?
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
What is it?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Did your father take a loan?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
What books?
Lady Van Tassel...
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
My suitor?
He has proposed to me twice.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
There is no such thing as magic.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Where are we going?
The church.
Ichabod...
Yes, actually.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
The Horseman.  Yes.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
She did not do it... please listen...
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
I can't remember.
All right then.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Yeah.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Leave.
Leave.
How'd your baptizin' go?
It went real good.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
I hate you!
Sure, I guess.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Why did he do that, reckon.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, I recollect it.
If you want me to.
Oh, jackin' off?
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
A little ol' boy.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I know he does.
Mama?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
You walk fast, don't you?
You better go get your things.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Well, okay. I got you some.
Ma'am?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
He just got out of the state hospital.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Will he be supervised?
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Better make it charge. 
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What'll it be, Auggie?
Huh?
The Queen of England?
He's crazy.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Yeah, probably.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Where to?
And what's that supposed to mean?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Lovely.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
Does it hurt?
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
The refrigerator?
Jesus.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Well?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
The what?
I didn't expect to see you again.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Eight-thirty.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Three nights.
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
You work too hard, you know that?
I just did.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
That's it. In a nutshell.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
Well?
It wasn't my fault.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Medium rare, please.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Closer to eight.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
And the next one...?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Greedy.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
That's when he fell.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
No spare.
Apparently.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Are you absol...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Such as?
Are these your bags?
Okay, doll.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
You mean it's a girls' band?
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I am.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Jerry - there's another problem.
That's some nerve!
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Interesting.
That's ridiculous.
I have a very low resistance.
What do you think you're doing?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
I was it.
Me too.  Bye now.
Most of the time I slap it.
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Tell what?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Rough?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
That must be it.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
- riding to hounds -
Guess!
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Oh - in here.
What a beautiful fish.
Champagne?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
Harmless - how?
What thing?
Nothing at all?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Have you ever tried American girls?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Daphne -
Booze.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Go where?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Big joke!
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
You know what I love about all this?
I should get going.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Um, just about everyone.
No.
Hey.
Ah, a philosopher.
Hey, Kat.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
You stand on your tiptoes.
A weekend?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Yes.
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
You have had girlfriends?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Yeah. You?
Hi, kiddo.
Yeah.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
Uh huh...
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Colored.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
You learnin' anything at that school?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
We didn't find Sounder yet.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
You bet we is!
From Miss Johnson --
You know somethin', Daddy?
David!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
What's that you carryin'?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Night, son!
Little chilly.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Dude!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Okay.
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Come on, just get to the message board!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Thank God, that sucked ass.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
No... The General is right.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
That was sweet!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Oh, brother.
Stan!
Oh dear God...
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Yes?
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
What did you do today Satan?
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Evening.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
You gotta think of your old age.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
That's right.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Why can't we?
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
I don't know what we're facing.
Oh my God.  What happened?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
I'm in the bridge.
So what's going to happen to you?
What the hell are you doing?
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
You're not from around here, are you?
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Need some advice, huh.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What's it look like to you?
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
No...
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Son?
Don't tell me, John.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
Junior.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
What if he wants to get out?
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Uh...over easy.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
No. Do You?
What's plan B?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Nothing.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Why not?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I feel sick.
Are you sure he's dead?
Where are you going?
Why did you come back?
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
They told me about sixty hours.
Direction's east coming!
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Increase positive pressure!
It's impossible.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
They pressurize us with helium.
Maybe we shouldn't.
What?
I think I do.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- and then brought her down here --
Edmunds?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Can you open that panel?
Nothing, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
I did.
Ted?  Captain?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
She wired this system.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Did you hear me, sir, because --
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Underwater?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
We have a library?
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
You don't trust me?
What's the matter?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
But how?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Antibiotic.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Beth!
Beth, stop it!
What?
Get away from me!
Would it work?
How's that?
No.  I don't think so.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Is it coming from our own computer?
I'm not being defensive.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
Not a clue.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
What is that?  That noise?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
She's cracking, Norman.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
Did I kill her?
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
No idea.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
You mean forget?
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
Does this mean what I think it means?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You mean you don't know?
Who's everyone?
You mean a picture?
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
That's where my father was killed.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Are you all right?
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
This isn't going to work.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Is he afraid of the water?
No need, everything's under control.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Did you read her mind ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
So ?
She's flying starships !
I don't want everyone to see.
Carl can wait.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
He's nothing like you.
I'm gonna miss you.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
Should I be ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
What ?
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
All bands.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
...CUT OFF !
Mr. Rasczak.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Well, yeah, sure...
What is your position ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Uh, I don't know.
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The examination is a normal function.
The Creator has not answered.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Granted.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
<U>Computer off</U>!
It's taken control of the computer...!
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Forward motion, Captain...!
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Cal...
Sure plan to.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
I quit the movie.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
I...
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
...such a pleasant sound.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What are you doing down there?
Fix my glasses.
Gonna' be good as new.
I don't drink.
Thank you.
Yes.
...yes.
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
That's right...
Is it...
What would you do with it, the printshop...
It does?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
Lookit that, up already.
What are you going to do?
Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
He's on the ph...
...why am I here...?
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
No, you're absolutely r...
I've always seen that.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
What's his name?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Why?
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
We, we have to give it.
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
An artist of your caliber...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Kiss my ass.
Where you off to?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
What's in the case?
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
He saw the girl in the car...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
The girl was in the car.
The girl was in the car.
For what cause?
I don't...
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
Marty...
Find the money.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Wow.  Who's that for?
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
You don't like his friends.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Ice cold water.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
IS THAT YOU?
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
But you can still see him.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
You say that like I don't know that.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
It's temporary.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Anxiety.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Don't flatter yourself.
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Okay, I'm undeserving.
And you said...?
I really look like shit.
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
That's not wh...
Thanks for coming out.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Ben never mentioned it.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
But?  But what?
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Rache, get out of th...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
That's not us.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
No prob. I'm cool.
Thank you.
Yes, Mikey?
Yes.
I'm always working.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
He wasn't.
So whaddya think?
No, you don't.
What's an audience going to tell you?
Marty...
You mean, again?
What do you want?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Reconceive.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
The same. Same as what?
Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Say, 'Nigger.'
'Fuck me hard!'
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, fine. How are you?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
How'd you get it?
Is it loaded?
You a pervert?
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Is he with the girl?
Now what?
She's still alive.
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
We can't--it's power driven!
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Possibly some coffee?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Don't be ridiculous.
Where are you trying to reach him?
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Didn't they tell you?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
That's right, sir.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Right.
Go on, Major.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
What the hell is Plan-R?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Yes?
What's the target.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
I think they mean business.
Yeah?
Where'd they get you?
No kidding.
That's what I said.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
What do you mean?
Who's that?
Are you sure?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
We are?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
That was really great.
Typical male.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
No I quit.
It's really not about anything.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
What?
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
I'd get bored.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
A long, long, long...
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Fuck it!
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
No, no, no.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Oh, you were there?
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Thanks. See man?
Yeah!
Military marching bands.
Really?
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
It's coming along.
Who were you talking to?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
No.
Well, w-what happened?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Wow. You did that for me?
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
No.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Nazeer what?
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
One!
But do you stand for anything?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Um, because you didn't want to go.
How?
Of course.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Hey, Pony.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
Now?
For a while.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Like?
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah?
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I can't believe you're still here.
If...
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About what?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
What?!
I'm in, too.
Cleo!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
I sure do.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Yeah?
You're kidding.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Hi, Artie.
Good party.
Name dropper.
If I could be of any help...
Why, you sweet kid.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
It's just impossible.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Whose?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Are you or aren't you?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I want you to do this work.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
It's getting kind of late --
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You'll like it here.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Just a scene I cut out.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
What's wrong with It?

Hold me tighter.
A little.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Did she read the script?
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
I made your bed this afternoon.
Good.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
No?
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Paramount studios.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
What is the scene? Where am I?
This is the staircase of the palace.
What does it mean?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
When can I see, you again ?
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Just like that?
I sort of like what you said.
Miss what?
And now?
You think so?
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
And you think you're in love.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Hey, where you going?
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
It doesn't seem right.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
A cheap trick.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
It's lovely. . .
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Why?
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
But Lana, you could --
Who?
You thought that?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Sure.
Nope, but --
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
How many sugars?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Columbia.
Turn on the T.V.
They ain't got captains?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Everything.
Can you do that?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Who's the other woman?
I didn't have my camera with me.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Missing????
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
What's wrong?
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
Are you okay?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
It is kinda romantic.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
What else could I do?
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Gee. But --
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Now This I want to hear.
My kind of people.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
What do you want?
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Put down Lex Luthor !
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Free!
What shall we do now?
You're late. Very late.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
An angle?
What's that?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
You think he'll find us.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
Bunkers!
Thank you.
A hot story, huh?
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Not...gray.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Can I take you to the airport?
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Super...man. Hmmm...
Listen...thank you.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Mr. Romance...
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
What do you suggest, my dear?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Boy!
He sure as heck does that.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Twenty-four.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Who...who...
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
How old are you?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I gave him this new face.
Please...
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
What is this??!
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That's right.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
She didn't.
I...don't think so.
I will.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
It's natural.
They can look forward to that.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Berry-picking.
What do you mean?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
What other people?
You hate it.
From you?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
What's a ditty again?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
The people in the town?
What do you mean?
Crafts?
Is this it?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Don't you want to hear?
Some more wine?
You've been retained?
Dolores?
Are you expensive?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
There wasn't time?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Nothing.
She'll move away.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
Alone or surrounded?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
See my mother?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
No, I wouldn't...
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Can I come in for a minute?
I know Manny Davis.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
But not for anything I did today...
Are you listening?
Talk to her, Sidney...
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
He goes out with girls.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
But...
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Those lying motherfuckers!
No one must follow your work.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Why?
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Chill out, dickwad.
Excellent.
Alriight!!  My man!
No!
Mom?  You okay?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Why attack Russia?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Respect your elders and your betters!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Some.
Yes.
Yes, David?
You bet.
Yeah.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
You do shorthand and typing?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Tough, tough!
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
And what was that?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
Then you are wrong.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
No!
Yes, I know who he is.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I have illegitimate children.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
Okay, so what is it?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
He did?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
The Miracle Kid.
So, you never heard of him.
Nope.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Alright!
Great.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
The what?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
What's he like?
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
That's not my mission.
My whole life has been combat.
He'll find us, won't he?
I don't think I like this.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
I just called.
Same shit.
Admittedly...
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
I'm so sorry.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Don't even think about it.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
That's classic.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Seriously?  What did they say?
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Do you mind if I sit?
What are you doing... ?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
I don't know.  A lot.
Get us out of here...
What do you think you're doing?
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
I saw them kill him!
Stop talking to them!
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
You look good.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Split it?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
I need your car, Elizabeth.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I'll call.  I really will.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Physical?
Get rid of them.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
It was a different floor then...
I need the police.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
His behavior... ?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Well, I... uh...
I only saw Theo drive up.
You could have.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
All right...
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
How'd I know it was for you?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Yes.  I've missed it.
Watts?
David?
What'd you come back for, babe?
What kind of food?
No.
Hey.
You think I'm staying?
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Lookin' good.
Eduardo.  Rama.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
You're kiddin' me, right?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
I've been wondering something.
Do you have any friends, man?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Had a feeling it was you.
How d'you mean?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Not embarrassed.
She never told Eddie, though.
He give me your address.
That's what was estimated.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
What about your grandmother?
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
How far?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Like what.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
What are you doing here?
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Who?
Yeah.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
You're an enthusiast.
...Mm.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
You got the dough?!
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
And how do we share--
She's a rare one.
All right, I guess.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
...What kind of man *are* you?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
You don't have to--
...OK.
OK, how did you know?
Yeah.
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
What the--
...Nah.
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
I don't understand.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Could you come with me please?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
I don't want to scare people.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
What doors?
Where the hell are you?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
If you don't mind, this could be important.
You're kidding.
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Lieutenant!  It's me.
What is it?
Curious.  There's something missing.
I don't believe it.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
How about lunch?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
How does it work?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
My God.  Then it was an animal.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
Wounded?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
What's to see?
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Nursery?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I won't be late.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
What's the hurry?
I don't know--
--we need more charcoal.
You hate gambling.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
How are you, Mother?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
You got it.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
You a reporter?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Those people were already dead.
Before the bomb went off?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
Mulder -- it's me --
I'm on the roof.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Where are you, Mulder?
I wake you?
I'd been told as much.
What kind of infection?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
This looks like new grass to you?
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Yeah, well they may this one.
Very weird.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Cold...
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
About what?
Are we being watched?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
You're lying.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where is he?
Our vaccine may have no effect!
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
He hates me.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I'll be fine.
Is it cold in here?
Do you think that's funny?
Agent Novak?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
Thank you.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Instead of going into his mind...
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Dr. Kent.
Now?
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
His own doctor?
Yes.
...at all.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
They're forged.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What are you going to do?
...you know.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
...quarrel?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Where's Harry?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Next, Paine.
So would I.
A girl of spirit.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Very popular, sir.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Dr. Winkel?
Thank you.
Could he have been conscious?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
A shark fin?
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
It's on an island that no one get to.
One kilometer
Incredible.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
No one follows that midrash.
What do you think you're doing?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
I don't care about money.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
No.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
What's it mean?
I want to learn to read it.
Where are they?
What's it about?
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
And Jewish men like to get it.
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
What were you, following me?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I can't say that.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Who knows what that is?
A Jewish prayer.
Which was his room?
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Why? Why would she?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
When do you want it to go off?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I can tell....
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Leary?
Funny?
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
They're not that Jewish.
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Johana, am I boring you?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
What d'you mean?
What's happened??
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Why?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Is he here?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
No.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Can I come in?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
But what brought you to Sicily?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
How can you tell it's a female?
How are you?
No... tell me.
It's my apartment.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Again?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
But... how is he going to breathe?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Want to get a drink?
What!?
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
So, how was I?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Is he in love with you?
This is for "mama and the kids."
Then what do you do?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's right, of course.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
It could be a man.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
I don't know.
It was you, Galbraith!
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Then you found the leopard --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
What do you do now?
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Go on foot.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Yes. The lipstick.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
Who is he?
And she waited here for him?
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
That’s right.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Laurence!
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Mr Lombard?
Are you all right?
Mr Lombard...
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
...You-you spoke to him?
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Something like that.
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
What...?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
Have we done business before?
May I have your phone number?
Tomorrow?
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
Where are we?
Where is it?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
I hope it’s not too significant.
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Where is Friedman?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Maybe I don’t.
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Trying to say something, Martin?
Three o’clock.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Er... Yes...
Welcome to the club.
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Mossad?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
No, but...
Will you at least let me stay with you?
Sound the retreat...
But that was her order!
I tried to.
Yes, but...
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
God defeated the English, not me.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
You did well...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
... You look wonderful...
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Supposing she's an assassin?
... as always, majesty...
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
No... not like this...
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Besides, what about these...?
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Who... who are you...?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Why would they?
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes, it is.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I don't want to wait for his call.
Dorota!
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Will I still be able to play?
Halina?
wish I knew you better.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Boys, boys...
We use what?
A good place for what?  He's insane!
I know.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
They were taking you away.
Very appropriate.
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Pig!
Bitch!
You made contact?
Out of Warsaw.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
I am... I was a pianist.
Are the Russians here?
Careful! Watch his hand.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
Ohh the tag is broken.
On your property?
T-w~e-l-v~e.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, words. You have never heard words?
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
He chopped it off
Oh no, it can't come now.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
And when is the next lesson?
Do I know any gigs?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
You got a bag or somethin?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You think my play is bad?
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
They're still looking for him.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
He threatened to kill me.
You think he'll show?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Yeh.
What's the problem?
The name is Lonnegan.
She coulda killed me last night.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
Then why the rat?
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
Why don't ya then.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What happened to your face?
How am I gonna do that?
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
We missed him.
For fifteen years.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
What?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
You're talking like a crazy person,
What is it? Has he found him?
I didn't.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
You know, we know each other.
Yes.
Come on in.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Where are you going?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
You've been there?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What about Jorgensen?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
You mean that body-----?
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Do you think that Wynant did it?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
I'll get some.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
You're going to return every cent of it!
I got word from Wynant this morning...
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I see.  I see.
No word at all?
My wife.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Well, don't you?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Perfectly absurd.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Can't you get to sleep?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Want a drink?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I never saw that before.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
Finished with these?
Hello... send him up.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Sit down!
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Goodbye, darling.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
Nick!
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
How long has he been dead?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Is that true?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Yes.  Nick!
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm sorry...  but...
Who fired you?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You don't know that.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Now this is war.
Invest it.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Steady it out!
She okay?
I heard it click.
Where you going?
You're going to blow yourselves up.
You're not losing trust, are you?
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
We'll find our way.
No.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Wonder how the war's going?
Slip out your M-16.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
I don't know!
But...
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
It doesn't mean anything.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
We...we could go home with something else.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Then lets go back while we still can.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Yeah, we're down.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Hurry up.
I'm not hungry.
Look, food!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Are you all right?
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
Not very encouraging.
Why are you so concerned?
I want you for my roommate.
You're in violation.
I'm leaving.
...and you're not lost now?
What kind of answer is that?
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
You don't know that!
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Coffee, Mike?
What was-? Why...?
Hey, look--
You guys seem pretty tight.
How do you know?
Fuck factor?
Nothing.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
I don't know.
"Punks", huh?
You got it.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Glass, what is it?
Who is he?
Then why tell me?
You okay?
Prints?
He is!
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Report on the case so far.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Well, have you found it?
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Amsterdam?
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I don't want to see you at all!
No, not at all!
M'sieu Monescu!
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
Monescu!
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
You like that statue?
That's what you need!
That's too dark.
Do you know my first name?
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
The same thing.
Then a little nap--
Good night. 
Any minute I want!
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Thirty-three--
No, m'sieu!
Yes, madame!
About what?
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
He started it.
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No--I'm sorry.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Good luck to you, Rose.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
I make my own luck.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
The fall alone would kill you.
I'm Jack Dawson.
Hello again.
Could I speak to you in private?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
What is it? A sapphire?
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Yes sir.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Montana?
You're coming back--
No gentleman would do that.
Where have you been hiding?
Brett is the name.
Don't be a c-a-t.
Yes?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
You can live that down, can't you?
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Three Jacks.
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
I thought you were a sucker--
That's too bad.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Yes--Me--in person!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Everything O.K.?
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
What's the matter, Mary?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
What d'you think of the singer?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
I don't understand.
Where'd you get that horse?
Come and get him.
Shut up, Ike.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Very cosmopolitan.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Doc...
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
What?  But I saw 'em-
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Easy now... That mare's in season.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
What can I get you?
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Well hello, Sherm.
That what you got me up here for?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
But -
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
... Shoelaces?
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
They point, I shoot.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Married?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I'll keep that in mind.
- You're not.
... Do you have a gun?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
What do you make of all this?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Who's in charge here?
You won't get away with this!
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Will you still get the money from your father?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
I could swear I heard my son call me.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Since this morning.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Wow!  Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
But Mom, I can't find him!
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Hey!  Wow!
Which one can I open first?
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
That's why.  Sid.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
But why would Andy want me?
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Ha-ha!!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh no, Hannah!
Oh, no!
Who is it this time?
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
It's Sid!
I can't hold on much longer!
Is that all?
You're not so old yourself!
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Did you now.
I already lost everything once.
Victoria -
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
What?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
How long have you known?
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Not yet.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Live with your parents?
Do you work?
You do?  What else you do?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Are you getting this on tape?
What do you think she wants?
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Depends who it's from.
Yes.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
You're breaking my heart.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
You first.
That's good coke.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
What?
If I can.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
What?
Hello.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Well, I've not brought them.
You've stabbed me, man.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Ssshh!
Come on.
Can I see you again?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Unless you get caught.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Oh, really?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Following the game at all?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Who wrote it?
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Cut it out.
Are you serious?
That's hardly a substitute.
No, I don't think so.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Went ballistic?
Well, what are you waiting for?
Admit it. We're lost.
Shuttle en route.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
Raise shields.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Life is not a dream.
Goodnight, Spock.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
About the ship...

Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Dillinger?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
How's it going upstairs?
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
For sure...
I'm your program?
You said it.
I'm sorry -
That was uncalled-for.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
What's that?
Greetings, program...
Hey... you guys OK?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
What's goin' on?
We have to talk.
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Thanks dear.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
It can't be.
I still don't believe it.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
What are you talking about?
She's still at my house.						*
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
And you still reach for your piece every time.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
What did you tell him?
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Not because you were attracted to him?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Did you pork her Harry?
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
What about the husbands?
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
What is it you want me to do?
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Gotten your mail yet?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Has he looked through it yet?
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
The oriental.
What do you do?
What kinda music do you like?
What are your turn-ons?
Almost four years.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
What would make you think that?
So he really loved her?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Who and what is a Drexl?
Is he nice?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Where you goin', honey?
You don't know him -
Was it him or you?
What?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
How come?
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Can you live with it?
Yeah.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Elliot Blitzer.
Clarence...
Do you really mean it?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Leave the gorillas.
What do you think, eightball?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He wants to talk ya.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
I can see what you mean.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Wanna count your money?
You were a cop.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Come again?
Where'd you come from?
Or a bit player -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
Suspect's words -
You do.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Put it in your pants.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
July?!
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
They're keeping an eye on me.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
You want me to rob him?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
They hurt you!
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
What are you talking about???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
What...virus?
You really want to know?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
You have him in restraints.
You want something, old man?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
He no!
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You don't fear death?
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Nope.  Darrell.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
You believe that?
No charge.
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
No, I've got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
What do you do anyway?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
My face tell you all that?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
I'm guessing no.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Where's the safe?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Where are you going?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Well, nothing.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
Husband . . .?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I have half a mind to--
How do you know if you've never tried?
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
I do.
I'm not rambling.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
No.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Two-hundred dollars.
I want to stay.
What?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You're fucked.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
Nooo!
The old lady?
A hundred-forty-five really.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I didn't do anything.
Eh?
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Oh, Jesus.
I think I've heard that before.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
A lot that means.
Say, what happened to your hand?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I did?
I'm not rambling.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
It's not what you think, Jake.
What?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
What the hell are you talking about?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
No charge.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
Jesus.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens when you lose?
I didn't say it bothered me.
My face tell you all that?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
You'd never understand.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Where?
Stop it.
Can you make it back up?
Which you don't have.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Beck's.
Son of a bitch!
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
...I can't remember.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
What about the game?
In college. A car accident.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
I mean if you knew karate?
I'm sleeping in my room.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Against a window.
Twelve years.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
I thought... you was an angel.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
All week?
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Maybe I ain't.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
He ain't killed.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Did... you... get... him?
First one I ever killed.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
He musta been movin' right along.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
HEY.
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
His pistol must of jammed.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
What was the money for?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
They want more time to think about investing.
They ruined me tonight.
Come home, Dean.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
No killing?
What is it Keaton?
What if I
You set up the line-up.
A little of both.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
He didn't have my lawyer.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
So this lawyer...
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
This is totally irrelevant.
I don't
Edie...
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
It looks that way.
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Yes.
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Neurology?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
I . . ..
I...yes.
I do.  Yes.
I thought I would need it.
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
Why is that?
I am seventy-four years old.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
I.  Yes.  It is.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
What is it?
I need an extension for my case.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Why?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe I can do something right.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
It's over!
I have to talk to you.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Hi, Mickey ...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
How are you holding up?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
Who told you that?
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Huh.  And why is that?
Should I?
Huh.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
Would you like a drink now?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello.
Did she hurt herself?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Judy Barton.
An hour?
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
The color of your hair...
Ah, no!
Scottie!
Can't you see?
Where are you going?
No!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Where were you?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
One shouldn't live alone.
How can you be sure?
No birds live here.
The tall trees...
No!... No!
Take me away from here?
Home?
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
No, never!
Let me go.
Where?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
More than you think.
Why?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
I've never run across one like that.
Uh-huh!
Normal.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
What.
I think I can lick it.
That!?!
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
For what?
Out!
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
How?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Well...
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Just giving the facts.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
So I didn't fucking do it!
We have to get going.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
There is no candy!
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
I know...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I don't think so.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
What is it?
What?
So who's the lucky guy?
Is everything okay?
What's your fucking point?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
Oh God. This is insane.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
What's your point?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
False.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed.
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I wouldn't know.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
He just doesn't talk a lot.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
What kind of seats can we have?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Of course.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
Hello.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
What?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
I love you dad.
Everything okay?
What does that mean?
I just want her to be happy.
I'm not breathing right.
You're not breathing right?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
My God...
That's a good one.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
"You Send Me."
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
Where's the camera?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
How could anybody behave like that?
Evil.
You must think I am a monster.
You must think I'm mad.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Ramona! Ramona!
She's mad.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
You see how much you like her?
Why?
Well... is it so urgent?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
What's going on, Moncho?
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Their weapons missing?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
I should have told him.
What happens if I can't catch him?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How does he know who I am?
It feels so.. .real.
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
It wasn't a lie.
You ready for this?
Who said that?
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
What the hell's going on?!
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
...I think so...You?
How's your pulse?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
It's <u>producing</u>.
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
...can we have a white one...?
Mr. President, this is St...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
When do we bring'em back?
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
It won't hold.
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
....we landing?
Who's gonna tell'em.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
<u>Who</u>?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
Why is this putz on the air...
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
...uh huh...
Wilfred.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
What about him?
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
My name is Ronald Brean.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
What's on your mind?
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that? 
Trade Re1ations.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Who?
Is that true?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
"The Country Is At War." 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
In the Folk Music Section.
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
You can't tell this story.
Why not?
...but...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
Black...
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
Yes. 
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
....beautiful.
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
a "pond," or
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
What's going on?
Hey the door was open.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
He never told me...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So what firm you with, pal?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Know the name?
What about hard work?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
How much?
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
How much is enough Gordon?
I gather you're a decorator.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
What if I have a previous engagement?
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Hi.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Can I give her a message?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Safety in numbers man.
Yes?
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I miss you.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Do you?
What?
I am.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
That's not...It's not like that.
This fence...it's so...
Thank you.
What was her major?
This is...
She got it.  Turned it down.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
You think he killed her?
Nothing's happening.
I have to go.
Okay.  Okay.
Oh God...you knew.
Why?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
I can't believe this is happening.
I guess not.
What's their name?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
You are...
In the house.  I was scared.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
What?  No.  No.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Get down!  He'll see.
What's going on, Claire?
Oh.
When you do this, I swear...
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
How did you--
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
I'm sorry...
What?
It's Madison Fra--
What's the matter?
I don't like this, this...
Claire, please don't...
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
There are two.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Lie...?
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
But I could understand. I want to understand!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Only you...
What is wrong...?
I do not understand...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
What do you see...?
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Rowan...?
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
That's GREAT!
Did you see the old man on the ---
When aid you get home last night...?
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
You can't just -
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
I heard something like that
I thought you were someone else
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
All the time?
No - not all the time - I mean
I'm sorry?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
So what do you do?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
Tell me how it happened...
What?
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
Why did you let him in?
Well, what do you think?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
See? Did you see that?
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
So far away? In Xenia?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
You go first.
Well. The prom's coming up.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Son.
Well, why should I?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Watch your tone, mister.
You do know how to drive?
Hmmm?
Can you believe that was me?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Great.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
He didn't. He had it built.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
He's on the move?
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Come on.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
How quaint.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
If you want company...
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
That bothers you?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Hi, Mon.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Hello.
But check this...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
No.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
You mean this thing?
But I..
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Hi, Sandy.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Well... that, too.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Not again.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
He calls it the Tarantula.
He's not giving up?
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Your private train, sir.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
No, sir... just a businessman.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Who was this partner of his?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
You left me to die, friend.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
They look like acorns.
Not today, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
You all right?
Are you a warrior?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Fresh goat's milk.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
You?
She's in love.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Kill him!
How am I gonna do that?
Ouch!!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
We gotta follow them.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
I'm getting her out of there!
I've seen pictures.
John, why?...
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
How reliable is this kid?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
Johnny –
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Who are they?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Where's the nearest telephone?
There was.
Aren't you? After today?
I got there late, John.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
You hear me?
Wrong.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Who was that man?
That has no place in this house.
I have committed no sin.
She say where he is?
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
Our echo.
...have you come back?
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Whenever you wish.
That's our farm!
Oh -- 
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Well, you're perfect now.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh --
Oh, he's just ascared again.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
What?
Oil can what?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Dorothy!
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Quiet!
...of the West.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Come on -- come on --
Yes.
You new?
What happened to Len Tashka?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
Then maybe I’d be... open to that.
Perhaps after this ... test?
I was the one who brought that money in...
He survived?
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
The inside man?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Yes.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
What is it?
No. You’ll be safe here.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
I’m coming with you.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
And the payoff on the tables?
What?
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Wrong answers?
I'm here, Laurie.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Old?
Antarctica??
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I can fix it.
Their real names, please.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Ever see one of these before?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
How will you fix it?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Yorgi asked me to.
Where are you going?
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
What's that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
Did you do your homework?
Toadies right behind.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
What was that for?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
I'm through, Xander.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
What's wrong with him?
What's that?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
A piece.  Only a piece.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
The way what is going to be?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Is it that music?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Whatever makes you happy.
Does that mean you love me?
Surprised?
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Yes!... the laboratory.
This is the only library I know of.
What?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
What wockers?
Fro-derick!
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Why?
What?
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
All right -- where is she?
Can you play it?
What???
That sound good, boss.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Oh, Doctor!
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
His schwanzstucker.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
